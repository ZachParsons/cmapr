Note
Early versions of Chapters 1, 3, 4, and 5 of this book were written in
Italian as entries of the Enciclopedia Einaudi; however, these have been
reworked and rewritten for the purposes of this book. Slightly different
versions of the following chapters have already been published in E nglish: "Signs" (Chapter I), as "The Sign Revisited," translated by Lucia
Re, Philosophy and Social Criticism 7 ( 1 980); "Metaphor" (Chapter 3), as
"The Scandal of Metaphor," translated by Christopher Paci, Poetics
Today 3 (1982); "Isotopy" (Chapter 6), as part of the article "Two Problems in Textual Interpretation," Poetics Today Ia ( 1 980). An earlier version of "Mirrors" (Chapter 7) was written for a volume in honor of
Thomas A. Sebeok for his sixty-fifth birthday. The translators mentioned above are not responsible for the changes in the final versions.
Figure 3-5 of this book is adapted from Groupe p.,, Rhetorique generate
(Paris: Larousse, 1 970), p. 1 09. Figure 6. I of this book is reprinted from
Umberto Eco, The Role of the Reader (Bloomington: Indiana U niversity
Press, 1 979), p. 14.
In the course of this book, I use (as I did in A Theory of Semiotics)
single slashes to indicate expressions; guillemets indicate the corresponding content. Thus /x/ means, or is an expression for, <<X». However, when it is not strictly necessary to stress such a distinction (that is,
when words or sentences are used as expressions whose corresponding
content is taken as intuitively understood), I simply use italics.
All the subjects dealt with in this book have been widely discussed
during the last four years in my courses at the University of Bologna and
during my visiting terms at Yale University and Columbia University;
many of the topics were also elaborated in the course of various congresses, symposia, seminars - in so many circumstances that it would be
difficult to be honest and exhaustive in expressing my gratitude to all
those students and colleagues who have contributed to the original d raft
with their objections and suggestions. I am, however, particularly indebted to Barbara Spackman and John Deely, who have kindly revised
part of the chapters.

INTRODUCTI ON
0.1.
The empirical reader of this book could have the impression that its
various chapters deal with two theoretical objects, mutually incompatible, each being focused on as the object of a general semiotic approach:
the sign, or the sign-function, and semiosis. The sign is usually considered as a correlation between a signifier and a signified (or between expression and content) and therefore as an action between pairs. Semiosis
is, according to Peirce, "an action, or influence, which is, or i nvolves, an
operation of three subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant,
this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into an action
between pairs" (C. P. 5.484).
The Model Reader should (as I hope) understand that the aim of this
book is to show that these two notions are not incompatible. If one
thinks of the more trivial and current notion of linguistic sign, one cannot match a theory of semiosis as indefinite interpretation with a 'doctrine of signs' ; in this case, one has to choose either a theory-of the sign
or a theory of semiosis (or of the significant practice, of the communicative processes, of textual and discursive activity). However, the main
purpose of this book is to show that such an alternative is a misleading
one: the sign is the origin of the semiosic processes, and there is no
opposition between the 'nomadism' of semiosis (and of interpretive activity) and the alleged stiffness and immobility of the sign . The concept
of sign must be disentangled from its trivial identification with the idea
of coded equivalence and identity; the semiosic process of interpretation
is present at the very core of the concept of sign .
Chapter I ( "Signs") shows that this idea was clearly spelled out by the
[1] 
[2) SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
classical doctrines where the semeion was not considered as an equivalence bu t as an inference.
Chapter 7 ("Mirrors") tackles the question of a threshold between
semiotic and presemiotic phenomena. The phenGmenology of our experience with mirror images represents the experimentum crucis for testing
the role played by two fundamental characteristics of any semiosic experience: a sign is an x standing for a y which is absent, and the process
which leads the interpreter from x to y is of an inferential nature.
Definition is the subject matter of Chapter 2 ( "Dictionary vs. E ncyclopedia"), from the allegedly Aristotelian model called the Porphyrian
Tre e to the contempora ry discussions on the possibility of an
encyclopedia-like representation of our semantic competence. In this
chapter, the current opposition 'dictionary/encyclopedia' is traced back
to the classical models of the tree and the labyrinth. /Tree/ and
/labyrinth/ are not metaphors. They are topological and logical models,
and as such they were and are studied in their proper domain. However,
I have no difficulties in admitting that, as labels or emblems for the
overall discussion developed in the various chapters of this book, they
can be taken as metaphors. As such, they stand for the nonmetaphoric
Peircean notion of unlimited semiosis and for the Model Q ou tlined in A
Theory of Semiotics (Eco 1 976).
If texts can be produced and interpreted as I suggested in The Role of
the Reader (Eco 1 979), it is because the universe ofsemiosis can be postulated in the format of a labyrinth. The regulative hypothesis of a
semiosic universe structured as a labyrinth governs the approach to other
classical issues such as metaphor, symbol, and code.
Metaphors can be read according to multiple interpretations; yet these
interpretations can be more or less legitimated on the grounds of an
underlying e ncycl opedic compe te nce . In this sense, Chapter 3
( "Metaphor") aims at improving some of the proposals of my essay "The
Semantics of Metaphor" (Eco 1 979, ch. 2), where the image of the
Swedish stall-bars required a more rigorous explanation in terms of a
representable encyclopedic network.
The notion of symbolic mode outlined in Chapter 4 ( "Symbol") accounts for all these cases of textual production that do not rely on a
preestablished portion of encyclopedia but invent and propose for the
first time a new interpretive connection.
o.:z.
The principle of interpretation says that "a sign is something by knowing which we know something more" (Peirce). The Peircean idea of
semiosis is the idea of an infinite process of interp retation. It seems that
the symbolic mode is the paramount example of this possibility. 
Introd uction [3]
However, interpretation is not reducible to the responses elicited by
the textual strategies accorded to the symbolic mode. The interpretation
of metaphors shifts from the univocality of catachreses to the open
possibilities offered by inventive metaphors. Many texts have undoubtedly many possible senses, but it is still possible to decide which one has
to be selected if one approaches the text in the light of a given topic, as
well as it is possible to tell of certain texts how many isotopies they display. (See Chapter 6, "Isotopy," where I discuss the many senses of the
concept of isotopy. ) Besides, we are implementing inferences (and we
are facing a certain interpretive freedom) even when we understand an
isolated word, a sentence, a visual sign.
All this amounts to saying that the principle of interpretation (in its
Peircean sense) has not to be identified with the farfetched assumption
that - as Valery said -if n'y a pas de vrai sens d'un texte.
When considering contemporary theories of interpretation (especially
in the literary domain), we can conceive of a range with two extremes x
and y. (I refuse to represent it spatially as a line going from left to right,
so as not to suggest unfair and misleading ideological connotations.) Let
us say that at the extreme x stand those who assume that every text (be
it a conversational utterance or a poem) can be interpreted in one, and
only one, way, according to the intention of its author. At the extreme y
stand those who assume that a text supports every interpretation - albeit
I suppose that nobody would literally endorse such a claim, except
perhaps a visionary devotee of the Kabalistic temura.
I do not think that the Peircean notion of semiosis should privilege
one of these extremes. At most, it provides a theoretical tool for identifying, according to different semiosic processes, a continuum of intermediate positions. If I ask someone what time it is and if he answers
/6: 1 5/, my interpretation of this expression can conclude that (provided
there are no other co-textual clues and provided the speaker is not a
notorious liar or a psychotic subject) the speaker positively said that it is
forty-five minutes to seven and that he intended to say so.
On the other hand, the notion of interpretation can explain both in
which sense a given text displays two and no more possibilities of disambiguation and why an instance of the symbolic mode requests an
indefinite series of alternative or complementary interpretations. In any
case, between x and y stands a recorded thesaurus of encyclopedic
competence, a social storage of world knowledge, and on these grounds,
and only on these grounds, any interpretation can be both implemented
and legitimated - even in the case of the most 'open' instances of the
option y. 
[4] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
O.J.
In order to discuss these points, all the chapters of this book, while
examining a series of fundamental concepts traditionally related to the
one of sign, revisit each of them from a historical point of view, looking
backward at the moment they were posited for the first time and were
endowed with a theoretical fecundity that sometimes they have lost in
the course of a millenary debate.
It is clear from the index that most of my authors are not linguists or
full-time semioticians, but philosophers who have speculated about
signs. This is not solely d ue to the fact that I started my academic career
as a philosopher, particularly interested in the Middle Ages, and that
since the Second Congress of the lASS (Vienna, 1 979) I have advocated
a revisitation of the whole history of philosophy (as well as of other disciplines) to take back the origins of semiotic concepts. This is not (or not
only) a book in which a semiotician pays a visit, extra moenia, to the alien
territory of philosophy. This is a book on philosophy of language for the
very simple reason that a general semiotics is nothing else but a philosophy of language and that the 'good' philosophies of language, from
Cratylus to Philosophical Investigations, are concerned with all the semiotic
questions.
It is rather difficult to provide a 'catholic' definition of philosophy of
language. In a nondogmatic overview, one should list under this heading
Plato's discussions on nomos and phusis, Aristotle's assumption that /Being/ is used in various senses, Russell's theory of denotation, as well as
Heidegger, Cassirer, and Merleau-Pon ty. I am not sure that a general
semio tics can a nswer all the q uestions ra ised during the last two
thousand years by the various philosophies of language; but I am sure
that all the questions a general semiotics deals with have been posited in
the framework of some philosophy of language.
0.4.
In order to make this point clear, one must distinguish between specific
semiotics and general semiotics. I understand that this is a very crude distinction as compared with more subtle classifications. I am thinking of
Hjelmslev's proposal according to which there are a scientific semiotic and
a nonscientific semiotic, both studied by a metasemiotic; a semiology as a
metasemiotic studying a nonscientific semiotic, whose terminology is studied
by a metasemiology. Since semiotics can be either denotative or connotative, there is also a meta (connotative) semiotic. Pelc ( 1981) has outlined a
far more analytical classification of the many levels of a semiotic study.
At the present state of the art, I am inclined to take these and other 
Introduction [5]
distinctions as fruitfully descriptive, while I am not sure that they can be
taken as normative. In any case, for the purposes of the present discourse, I think it will be sufficient to work upon the distinction between
general and specific.
A specific semiotics is, or aims at being, the 'grammar' of a particular
sign system, and proves to be successful insofar as it describes a given
field of com municative phenomena as ruled by a system of signification.
Thus there are 'grammars' of the American Sign Language, of traffic
signals, of a playing-card ' matrix' for different games or of a particular
game (for instance, poker). These systems can be studied from a syntactic, a semantic, or a pragmatic point of view. Sometimes a specific
semiotics only focuses on a particular subsystem (or s-code, as defined in
Eco 1 976) that works within a more complex system of systems: such is
the case of the theory of phonemic distinctive features or of the description of the phonemic oppositions holding for a given verbal language.
Every specific semiotics (as every science) is concerned with general
epistemological problems. It has to posit its own theoretical object, according to criteria of pertinence, in order to account for an otherwise
disordered field of empirical data; and the researcher must be aware of
the underlying philosophical assumptions that influence its choice and
its criteria for relevance. Like every science, even a specific semiotics
ought to take into account a sort of 'uncertainty principle' (as anthropologists must be aware of the fact that their presence as observers
can disturb the normal course of the behavioral phenomena they observe). Notwithstanding, a specific semiotics can aspire to a 'scientific'
status. Specific semiotics study phenomena that are reasonably independent of their observations. Their objects are usually 'stable' - even
though the duration of a code for traffic signals has a shorter range than
the duration of a phonological system, whereas lexical systems are in a
continuous process of transformation. Being scientific, a specific semiotics can have a predictive power: it can tell which expressions, produced
according to the rules of a given system of signification, are acceptable or
'grammatical' and which ones a user of the system would presumably
prod uce in a given situation.
Obviously, there are different degrees of scientificity, according to the
rigidity or the flexibility of the sign system in question. The 'grammar'
of traffic lights and the structure of a phonological system seem to be
more 'objective' (more 'scientific') than the description of the narrative
function in Russian fairy tales; and the narrative function of the Russian
fairy tales seems to be less questionable than, let us say, a possible system of narrative function in the novels of French Romanticism. Not
every specific semiotics can claim to be like a natural science. In fact,
every ·specific semiotics is at most a human science, and everybody 
[6] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
knows how controversial such a notion still is. However, when cultural
anthropology studies the kinship system in a certain society, it works
upon a rather stable field of phenomena, can produce a theoretical object, and can make some prediction about the behavior of the members
of this society. The same happens with a lexical analysis of the system of
terms expressing kinship in the same society.
In this sense, a specific semiotics (as any other science) can also have
effects in terms of social engineering. When the anthropologist increases
our knowledge of a given society, his or her descriptions can be used for
'missionary' purposes in order to improve, to preserve, or to destroy a
given culture, or to exploit its members. It goes without saying that the
natural sciences h ave e ngineering purposes, not only in the s tric t
technological sense; a good knowledge of human anatomy also can help
one to improve one's physical fitness. In the same way, the description
of the internal logic of road signals can suggest to some public agency
how to improve the practice of road signali ng. Such an engineering
power is the result of a free decision, not an automatic side effect of the
scientific research.
Al l a round this a rea of more or less establis hed and rigorous
'grammatical' knowledge is a hardly definable 'twilight zone' of semiotically oriented practices, such as the application of semiotic notions to
literary criticism, the analysis of political discourses, perhaps a great part
of the so-called linguistic philosophy when it attempts "to solve philosophical problems by analyzing the meanings of words, and by analyzing
logical relations between words in natural languages" (Searle 1 971 :1).
Frequently, these semiotic practices rely on the set of knowledge provided by specific semiotics, sometimes they contribute to enriching
them, and, in many other cases, they borrow their fundamental ideas
from a general semiotics.
o.s.
The task and the nature of a general semiotics are different. To outline a
project for a general semiotics, it is not sufficient to assert, as Saussure
did, that language is a system comparable to writing, symbolic rites,
deaf-mute alphabets, military signals, and so on, and that one should
conceive of a science able to study the life of signs within the framework
of social and general psychology. In order to conceive of such a science,
one must say in which sense these different systems are mutually comparable: if they are all systems in the same sense of the word system; if,
by consequence, the mutual comparison of these systems can reveal
common systematic laws able to explain, from a unified point of view,
their way of functioning. Saussure said that such a science did not exist
as yet, even though it had a right to exist. Many semioticians assume 
Introduction [7]
(and I rank among them) that Peirce in fact outlined such a discipline;
but others maintain (and I still rank among them) that such a discipline
cannot be a science in the sense of physics or electronics.
Thus the basic problem of a general semiotics splits into three different questions: (a) Can one approach many, and apparently different,
phenomena as if they were all phenomena of signification and/or of
com munication? (b) Is there a u nified approach able to account for all
these semiotic phenomena as if they were based on the same system of
rules (the notion of system not being a mere analogical one)? (c) Is this
approach a 'scientific' one?
If there is something which deserves the name of general semiotics,
this something is a discourse dealing with the questions above, and this
d iscourse is a philosophical one. In any case, it encounters the problem
raised by philosophy of language because, in order to answer the questions above, it is obliged to reconsider, from a general (not merely 'linguistic') point of view, classical issues such as meaning, reference, truth,
context, communicational acts (be they vocal or else), as well as many
logical problems as analytic vs. synthetic, necessity, implication, entailment, inference, hypothesis, and so on.
Naturally, many problems that originally were simply philosophical
now belong to the province of some science. Perhaps in the future some
of the problems raised today by a general semiotics will find a 'scientific'
answer - for instance, the debated and still speculative problem of the
universals of language, today tackled by the catastrophe theory. Some
others will remain purely philosophical.
General semiotics was first of all concerned with the concept of sign.
This concept is better discussed in Chapter 1, where I give the reasons
why I think it is still tenable, despite the various criticisms it has undergone. It must be clear that one can decide that the theoretical object of
semiotics can be a different and more fruitful one, let us say, text,
semiosis, significant practice, communication, discourse, language, effability, and so on - but the real problem is not so much which object has
to be appointed as the central one; the problem is to decide whether
there is a unified object or not. Now, this object (let it be the concept of
sign) can become the central object of a general semiotics insofar as one
decides that such a category can explain a series of human (and maybe
animal) behaviors, be they vocal, visual, termic, gestural , or other. In
this sense, the first question of a general semiotics is close to the capital
question of any philosophy of language: what does it mean for h uman
beings to say, to express meanings, to convey ideas, or to mention states
of the world? By which means do people perform this task? Only by
words? And, if not, what do verbal activity and other signifying or communicative activities have in common?
A general semiotics at most improves some of the traditional ap-
[8] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
proaches of philosophy of language. It assumes that it is impossible to
speak about verbal language without comparing it to other forms of
signification and/or communication. In this sense, a general semiotics is
fundamentally comparative in its approach. But it is enough to think ­
for instance - of Wittgenstein, Husser!, or Cassirer to realize that a good
philosophy of language necessarily takes up this issue.
A general semiotics is influenced, more than any philosophy of language, by the experiences of specific semiotics. But the history of philosophy displays other examples of speculations about signification and
communication that have attempted to elaborate a systematic approach
to every sort of 'language' - starting from the results and from the
technicalities of some specific semiotics. Thus a general semiotics is
simply a philosophy of language which stresses the comparative and systematic approach to languages (and not only to verbal language) by
exploiting the result of d ifferent, more local inquiries.
0.6.
Not all philosophers of language would agree with such a project. Many
of them assume that the categories provided in order to explain verbal
language - incl uding 'signification' , 'meaning' , and 'code' - cannot hold
when applied to other systems of signification. In Chapter I of this
book, I discuss a strong objection formulated in this line of thought,
according to which semiotics unduly fuses three different problems concerning three different and mutually irreducible phenomena, studied by
three different theoretical approaches - namely, intended meaning, inference from evidences, and pictorial representation. It goes without saying that,
on the contrary, I assume that these three problems concern a unique
theoretical object. Elsewhere (Eco 1 976) I discussed in which sense verbal signific ation and picto rial re p re sentation (as well as other
phenomena) can be subsumed under the general model of the signfunction. Here I shall maintain that inferential processes (mainly under
the form of Peircean abduction) stand at the basis of every semiotic
phenomen'on.
It has been suggested (see, for instance, Scruton 1 980) that the word
sign means too many things and points to many functions; thus semiotics
would play on mere - and weak - analogies when it asserts that a cloud
means rain in the same sense in which the French sentence 'je m'ennuie'
means that I am bored. What these two phenomena have in common is
"only a small feature on the surface of each" and "if there is a common
essence of 'signs' it is sure to be very shallow; semiology pretends that it
is deep" (Scruton 1 980). I suspect that no semiotician would say that on
the surface a cloud and a sentence have something in common. As I recall
in Chapter I of this book, Greek philosophers took a long time to rec-
Introduction [9]
ognize that there was some relation between 'natural signs' and words,
and even the Stoics, who decidedly approached the problem, found
some difficulty in settling it definitively. This means that, if a cloud and
a sentence have something in common, this something is not shallow but
deep.
On the other hand , there is something 'intuitively' common to the red
light of a traffic signal and the verbal order /stop/. One does not need to
have a semiotic mind to understand this. The semiotic problem is not so
much to recognize that both physical vehicles convey more or less the
same command; it begins when one wonders about the cultural or cognitive mechanisms that allow any trained addressee to react to both
sign-vehicles in the same way. To realize that /stop/ and the red light
convey the same order is as intuitive as to decide that, to convince
people to refrain from drinking a certain liquid, one can either write
/poison/ or draw a skull on the bottle. Now, the basic problem of a
semiotic inquiry on different kinds of signs is exactly this one: why does
one understand something intuitively?
As posited this way, the question is more than semiotic. It starts as a
philosophical question (even though it can have a scientific answer, too).
Frequently, one uses the adjective 'intuitive' as an empiricist shibboleth
and gets rid of a lot of interesting questions by recu rring to 'intuitive
truths' . To say that some truth is intuitive usually means that one does
not want to challenge it for the sake of economy - that is, because its
explanation belongs to some other science. However, one (if not the
most important) of the semiotic endeavors is to explain why something
looks intuitive, in order to discover under the felicity of the so-called
intuition a complex cognitive process.
It is intuitive that I can seduce a lady, a potential partner in an important business, or a corrupt politician, either by saying that I am rich and
generous or by offering her or him a titillating d inner in the most luxurious restaurant of the city, with a menu that would have syntagmatically
delighted Roland Barthes. It is equally intuitive that probably the dinner
would be more convincing than a crude verbal statement. It is n
-
ot intuitive why all this is intuitive. Perhaps it is by virtue of a 'shallow' similarity in their effect that one intuitively understands that both behaviors
produce ideas and emotions in the mind of the potential victim. B ut, in
order to explain how both behaviors produce the same effect, one should
look for something 'deeper' . To look for such a deeper common s tructure, for the cognitive and cultural laws that rule both phenomena ­
such is the endeavor of a general semiotics. Once having addressed this
problem, one probably would be in the position of deciding whether the
same cultural or cognitive mechanisms also hold in the case of the cloud
and the sentence.
Notice that semiotics is not strictly obliged to answer positively to all 
[10] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
the questions raised above; it can also decide, for instance (as many
semioticians did), that the way in which a cloud signifies rain is different
from the way in which a French sentence signifies - or is equivalent
to - an allegedly corresponding E nglish sentence. Semiotics is characterized by its interest in these problems, not by a prerecorded set of
answers.
To be interested in these problems requires a philosophical curiosity;
according to Aristotle, it is by an act of wonder that men began, and
begin, to philosophize; and, according to Peirce, all new discoveries start
when "we find some very cu rious circumstances which will be explained
by the supposition that it was the case of a general rule and thereupon
adopt that supposition" (C. P. 2. 624). The concept of sign - or every
other concept a general semiotics decides to posit as its own theoretical
object - is nothing but the result of a supposition of this sort. Signs are
not empirical objects. Empirical o bjects become signs (or they are
looked at as signs) only from the point of view of a ph ilosophical
decision.
o.,.
When semiotics posits such concepts as 'sign', it does not act like a
science; it acts like philosophy when it posits such abstractions as subject, good and evil, truth or revolution. Now, a philosophy is not a science, because its assertions cannot be empirically tested , and this impossibility is due to the fact that philosophical concepts are not 'ernie'
definitions of previously recognizable 'etic' data that display even minimal resemblance in shape or function. Philosophical entities exist only
insofar as they have been philosophically posited. Outside their philosophical framework, the empirical data that a philosophy organ izes lose
every possible unity and cohesion.
To walk, to make love, to sleep, to refrain from doing somethi ng, to
give food to someone else, to eat roast beef on Friday - each is either a
physical event or the absence of a physical event, or a relation between
two or more physical events. However, each becomes an instance of
good , bad , or neutral behavior within a given philosophical framework.
Outside such a framework, to eat roast beef is radically different from
making love, and making love is always the same sort of activity independent of the legal status of the partners. From a given philosophical
point of view, both to eat roast beef on Friday and to make love to x can
become instances of 'sin' , whereas both to give food to someone and to
make love to y can become instances of virtuous action.
Good or bad are theoretical stipulations according to which, by a
philosophical decision, many scattered instances of the most different 
Introduction [11]
facts or acts become the some thing. It is interesting to remark that also the
notions of 'object', 'phenomenon', or 'natural kind', as used by the natural sciences, share the same philosophical nature. This is certainly not
the case of specific semiotics or of a human science such as cultural
anthropology. Anthropologists elaborate the notion of brother-in-law to
define emically a series of etic occurrences, where different persons play
the same social function - and they would play this function etically
even though no science had previously defined their ernie role. A
brother-in-law exists independently as a male human being who, like
other male human beings , has a sister who has married another male
human being; like other male human beings in the same position, a
brother-in-law performs (during certain ceremonies) certain ritual acts,
allegedly because of his relationship with a given woman and a given
man. Anthropologists can fail in detecting the true reason he performs
these ritual acts or in selecting certain features of his behavior as relevant, disregarding other phenomena (or can overdo in asserting that the
opposition brother-in-law/sister-in-law is analogous to the phonetic opposition voiced/unvoiced ... ). But the anthropologists start from the
unquestionable fact that there are nuclei of three persons each, forming
both a couple of siblings of the same parents and a couple of persons of
different sex living and having sex together.
In philosophy things go differen tly. What is 'true' for Hegel is radically different from what is 'true' for Tarski , and, when the Schoolmen
said that truth is the odoequotio rei et intellectus, they did not describe
entities that were recognizable as such before that definition. The definition decides what a thing is, what unders tanding is, and what
odoequotio is.
This does not mean that a philosophy cannot explain phenomena. It
has a great explanatory power, since it provides a way to consider as a
whole many otherwise disconnected data - so that, when a scientific
approach starts with defining an observable datum and a correct (or true)
observation, it starts by positing ph ilosophical categories. A philosophy
cannot, however, be true in the sense in which a scientific description
(even though depending on previous philosophical assumptions) is said
to be true. A p hilosophy is true insofar as it satisfies a need to provide a
coherent form to the world, so as to allow its followers to deal coherently
with it.
In this sense, a philosophy has a practical power: it contributes to the
changing of the world . This practical power has nothing to do with the
engineering power that in the discussion above I attributed to sciences,
including specific semiotics. A science can study either an animal species
or the logic of road signals, without necessarily determining their transformation. There is a certain 'distance' between the descriptive stage 
[1 2] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
and the decision, let us say, to improve a species through genetic
engineering or to improve a signaling system by reducing or increasing
the number of its pertinent elements.
On the contrary, it was the philosophical position of the modern notion of thinking subject that led Western culture to think and to behave
in terms of subjectivity. It was the position of notions such as class
struggle and revolution that led people to behave in terms of class, and
not only to make revolutions but also to decide, on the grounds of this
philosophical concept, which social turmoils or riots of the past were or
were not a revolution. Since a philosophy has this practical power, it
cannot have a predictive power. It cannot predict what would happen if the
world were as it described it. Its power is not the direct result of an act
of engineering performed on the basis of a more or less neutral description of independent data. A philosophy can know what it has produced
only apres coup. Thinkerism as a philosophy displays a reasonable explanatory power and has had , indeed , a consistent pra'Ctical power: it contributed to the transformation, in the long run, of many ideas and some
states of the world . It failed when, assuming to be a science, it claimed
to have a predictive power: it transformed ideas and states of the world
in a direction it could not exactly foresee. Applying to globality, a philosophy does not play its role as an actor d uring a recital; it interacts with
other philosophies and with other facts, and it cannot know the results of
the interaction between itself and other world visions. World visions can
conceive of everything, except alternative world visions, if not in order
to criticize them and to show their inconsistency. Affected as they are by
a constitutive solipsism, philosophies can say everything about the world
they design and very little about the world they help to construct.
o.S.
A general semiotics is philosophical in this very sense. It cannot work on
concrete evidence, if not as already filtered by other specific semiotics
(which depends on a general semiotics to be justified in their procedures). A general semiotics studies the whole of the hu man signifying
activity - languages - and languages are what constitutes human beings
as such, that is, as semiotic animals. It studies and describes languages
through languages. By studying the human signifying activity it i nfluences its course. A general semiotics transforms, for the very fact of its
theoretical claim, its own object.
I do not know, as yet, whether a pragmatic theory of speech acts is a
chapter of general semiotics or a chapter of a philosophy of language. It
should be clear, from the whole of this introduction, that such a question
is, to me, devoid of a ny interest. Undoubtedly, a theory of speech acts 
Introduction [13]
starts from the observation (although never innocen t) of certain empirical
behaviors . In this sense, many of its discoveries could be ranked as items
of a specific semiotics. However, I doubt whether a notion such as the
one of performative sentence is a neutral one. One says /1 promise you/
and bets one's shirt on this promise; in other cases, one u tters the same
expression without being aware of the fact that one is 'doing things with
words' . But a theory of speech acts provides us with such an organized
knowledge of our linguistic interaction that the future of our linguistic
behavior cannot but be profoundly influenced by the sort of awareness it
provides. So a theory of speech acts is explanatory, practically powerful,
and not fully predictive. It is an instance of philosophy of language,
perhaps a chapter of a general semiotics, not a case of specific semiotics.
I am not saying that philosophies, since they are speculative, speak of
the nonexistent. When they say 'subject' or 'class struggle' or 'dialectics' , they always point to something that should have been defined and
posited in some way. Philosophies can be j udged , at most, on the
grounds of the perspicacity with which they decide that something is
worthy of becoming the starting point for a global explanatory hypothesis. Thus I do not think that the sign (or any other suitable object for a
general semiotics) is a mere figment. Notwithstanding, signs exist only
for a philosophical glance which decides to see them where other minds
see only the fictive result of an analogical 'musement' .
Certainly, the categories posited by a general semiotics can prove their
power insofar as they provide a satisfactory working hypothesis to specific semiotics. However, they can also allow one to look at the whole of
human activity from a coherent point of view. To see human beings as
signifying animals - even outside the practice of verbal language - and
to see that their ability to produce and to interpret signs, as well as their
ability to draw inferences, is rooted in the same cognitive structures,
represent a way to give form to our experience. There are obviously
other philosophical approaches, but I think that this one deserves some
effort. 
[I]
SIGNS
1.1. Crisis of a concept
Current handbooks of semiotics provide us with different definitions of
the concept of sign which are often complementary rather than contradictory. According to Peirce, a sign is "something which stands to
somebody for something in some respect or capacity" (C. P. 2 . 228). This
defi nition is a more articulate version of the classical definition aliquid
stat pro aliquo. When dealing with the inner structure of the sign, Saussure speaks of a twofold entity (signifier and signified). Hjelmslev's definition, which assumes the sign-function as a mutual correlation between
two functives (expression-plane and content-plane), can be taken as a
more rigorous development of the Saussurean concept.
However, in the same period at the turn of the century in which
semiotics asserted itself as a discipline, a series of theoretical propositions concerning the death, or at least the crisis of the concept, of sign
was developed . Throughout the history of Western thought, the idea of a
semiotic theory - however differently defined - was always labeled as a
doctrine of signs (see Jakobson 1 974; Rey 1 973 ; Sebeok 1 976; Todorov
1 977). The disparity of meanings attributed each time to the notion of
sign calls for a rigorous critique (at least in the Kantian sense of the word
'critique'). We shall see, however, that the notion of sign had been seriously questioned in this sense since the very beginning.
In '"the last few years, this reasonable critical attitude seems to have
generated its own mannerism. Since it is rhetorically effective to begin a
course in philosophy by announcing the death of philosophy, as Freud is
pronounced dead at the opening of debates on psychoanalysis, many
people have deemed useful to start out in semiotics by announcing the
[14] 
Signs [15]
death of the sign. This announcement is rarely prefaced by a philosophical analysis of the concept of sign or by its reexamination in terms of
historical semantics. The death sentence is therefore pronounced upon
an entity which, being without its identity papers, is likely to be resuscitated under a different name .
1.2. The signs of an obstinacy
Everyday language and the dictionaries which record its usages disregard
theoretical discussions and insist on using the notion of sign in the most
varied ways. Even too varied. A phenomenon of this kind deserves attention.
I.:Z.I.
First of all, we find a cluster of linguistic usages according to which the
sign is a manifest indication from which inferences can be made about
something latent. This includes the usage of sign for medical symptoms,
criminal evidence, weather forecast, premonitory signs, presages, the
signs of the coming of the Antichrist .... A sample of urine for analysis
was called signum by the ancients, which leads us to think in terms of a
synecdochic relationship, as if the sign were a part, an aspect, a peripheral manifestation of something which does not appear in its entirety.
But the relationship appears to be a metonymic one as wel l, since the
dictionaries speak of sign also for any trace or visible imprint left by an
imprinter on a surface. Therefore, the sign is also revelatory of a contact,
in a way which tells us something about the shape of the imprinter.
These signs, besides revealing the nature of the imprinter, may become
marks of the imprinted objects - for instance, bruises, scratches, scars
(identifying marks). Ruins belong to the same category: they are the
signs of ancient grandeur, of human settlement, or of the flourishing
trades of the past.
In all these cases, the fact that the sign is produced intentionally or by
a human sender is not relevant. Any natural event can be a sign. Morris
asserted that "something is a sign only because it is interpreted as a sign
of somethii?-g by some interpreter. Semiotics, then, is not concerned
with the study of a particular kind of obj ect, but with ordinary objects
insofar (and only insofar) as they participate in semiosis" (1938: 20).
However, this first category of signs seems to be characterized by the
fact that the 'standing for' relationship is based on an inferential mechanism: if red sky at night, then sailor' s delight. It is the Philonian mechanism of implication: p ::J q. The Stoics were thinking about this sign
category when they asserted that a sign is "a proposition constituted by a
valid and revealing connection to its consequent" (Sextus Empiricus, 
[16] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
Adv. Math. 7. 245). The same sign category was the object of Hobbes'
and Wolff's .definitions. According to Hobbes, a sign is the evident
antecedent of .a consequent or the consequent of an antecedent when
similar consequences have previously been observed (Leviathan 1.3). For
Wolff, a sign is "an entity from which the present or future or past existence of another being is inferred" (Ontology, p. 952).
1.2.2.
Common language, though, points to a second category of signs. The
sign is a gesture produced with the intention of communicating, that is, in
order to transmit one's representation or inner state to another being.
The existence of a certain rule (a code) enabling both the sender and the
addressee to understand the manifestation in the same way must, of
course, be presupposed if the transmission is to be successful; in this
sense, navy flags, street signs, signboards, trademarks, labels, emblems,
coats of arms, and letters are taken to be signs. Dictionaries and cultivated language must at this point agree and take as signs also words, that
is, the elements of verbal language. In all the cases examined here, the
relationship between the aliquid and that for which it stands seems to be
less adventurous than for the first category. These signs appear to be
expressed by a relation of equivalence rather than by one of inference: p
= q. /Woman/ = •ifemme or donna»; or /woman/ = «animal, human,
feminine, adult». Furthermore, these signs seem to depend on arbitrary
decisions.
I.:Z.J.
The clear opposition between the two categories mentioned above is
upset by the use of the word sign in relation to those so-called symbols
which represent abstract objects and relationships, such as logical, chemical , algebraic formulas, and diagrams. They appear as arbitrary as the
signs of the second category; yet, through a structural formula or a d iagram, the operations which I perform on the expression modify the content. If these operations are performed following certain rules, the result
provides me with new information about the content. By altering the
lines of a topographical chart, I can predict the possible order of the
corresponding territory; by inscribing triangles within a circle, I discover
new properties of the circle. This happens because in these sign there
are one-to-one correspondences between expression and content. Therefore, they are usually arbitrary and yet contain elements of motivation. As
a consequence, the signs of the third category, even though emitted by
human beings with the intention of communicating, seem to follow the
same model as the signs of the first category: p ::J q, even though they
are not natural . They are called iconic or analogical. 
Signs [17]
1.2-4-
In a similar way, any visual procedure reproducing concrete objects, such
as the drawing of an animal in order to communicate the corresponding
object and concept, is considered to be an iconic sigh. What do drawings
and diagrams have in common? The fact that I can perfo rm on
them certain operations: if I draw a moustache on my portrait, I know
what I will look like if I wear a moustache. What makes them different?
The (apparent) fact that the diagram responds to highly codified and
precise rules of production, whereas the drawing appears more spontaneous. Also, the diagram reproduces an abstract object, whereas the
drawing reproduces a concrete obj ect. But this is not always true: the
unicorns of the B ritish royal coat of arms stand for an abstraction, a fictitious object; they stand at most for a (an imaginary) class of animals.
On the other hand , Goodman ( 1968) discusses at length the problematic
difference between a person's i mage and the image of a person. What
makes the difference between the two? Is it related to the intensional
properties of the content reproduced by the drawing or to the extensional use that we decide to make of the drawing? The problem was
present already (and not entirely resolved) in Plato's Cratylus.
1.2.5.
However, com mon usage also considers as signs those drawings which
reproduce something, but in a stylized form, so that recognizing the object represented is less important that recognizing a con tent 'other' for
which the represented obj ect stands. The Cross, the Crescent, the
Hammer and Sickle stand for Christianity, Islam, and Communism, res pec tively. These signs are ico n ic because - l ike diagra ms and
drawings - they can be subjected to manipulations of the expressions
which affect the content. They are also arbitrary because by now they
are in a state of catachresis. They are com monly called symbols, but in a
sense opposite to that adopted for formulas and diagrams. Whereas the
latter are quite empty, open to any meaning, the former are quite full,
filled with multiple but definite meanings.
1.2.6.
Finally, certain languages - for instance, Italian - adopt expressions
such as colpire nel segno (to hit the target, to touch the sme spot), mettere a
segno (to score, as in to score an uppercut), fare un segno dove si deve
tag/iare (to draw a dressmaker's pattern for where the cloth is to be cut),
passare il segno (to overstep the mark): signs as targets, termina ad quae, to
be used as markings in order to proceed in a thorough way (per fila e per
segno ). The aliquid in this case, rather than standing for, stands where a
certain operation is to be addressed. It is an instruction rather than a 
[1 8] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
substitution. In this sense, the North Star is a sign for the sailor. The
structure of the link is inferential , but with some complications: if p
now, and if therefore you will do z, then you will obtain q.
I .J. Intension and extension
Too many things are signs, and too different from each other. This turmoil of homonymies is complicated by a further equivocation. Is the sign
"res, praeter speciem quam ingerit sensibus, aliud aliquid ex se faciens in cognitationem venire" (Augustine, De Doctrina Christiana 2. I .1 ), or, as in
elsewhere suggested by the same Augustine, is the sign something by
which we indicate objects or states of the world? Is the sign an intensional or an extensional device? Let us attempt an analysis of a typical
semiotic maze. A red flag with a Hammer and Sickle is equivalent to
Com munism (p = q). But if someone carries a red flag with a Hammer
and Sickle, then that person is probably a Com munist (p ::J q). If we take
a statement such as at home I have ten cats, what is the sign? Is it the word
cats (domestic felines), the global content of the sentence (in my house I
keep ten domestic felines), the reference to the fact that it j ust so happens that within the world of our actual experience there is a specific
house where there are ten specific cats? Or is it the fact that, if I have
ten cats at home, then I must have enough space for them, then I probably cannot keep a dog, and then I am an animal lover? Furthermore, in
all these cases, what constitutes the sign? Is it the concrete occurrence or
the abstract type? Is is the phonetic utterance [kat], or the phonological
and lexical model /cat!? Is it the fact that hie et nunc I have ten cats at
home (with all the possible inferences), or the class of all the facts of this
nature, so that anyone who somehow happens to have ten cats at home
will show himself or herself to be an animal lover who cannot possibly
keep a dog?
1-4- Elusive solutions
Some people claim that the word sign can be applied only to linguistic
entities. Malmberg, for i nstance, decides to call a sym bol any element
representing something else, and to keep the term 'sign' to indicate
"those units which, like the signs of language, have a double articulation
and owe their existence to an act of signification" (where signification
means intentional communication) (1977: 21). Every sign is a symbol,
but not every symbol is a sign. This decision , in itself moderate, does
not determine, however, (a) to what extent signs are relatable to symbols
and (b) which science should study symbols and which categories should
be employed . Furthermore, the difference between extension and in-
Signs [ 1 9]
tension is not clarified, even though the study of signs is presumed to be
intensionally oriented.
This distinction between areas is suggested at times on the basis of
more radical epistemological intentions. Harman, for instance, argues as
follows:
Smoke means fire and the word combustion means fire, bur nor in the same
sense of means. The word means is ambiguous. To say that smoke means fire
is to say that smoke is a symptom, sign, indication, or evidence for fire. To
say that the word combustion means fire is to say that people use the word to
mean fire. Furthermore, there is no ordinary sense of the word mean in
which a picture of a man means a man or means that man. This suggests
that Peirce's theory of signs would comprise at least three rather different
subjects: a theory of the intended meaning, a theory of evidence, and a
theory of pictorial depiction. There is no reason to think that these theories
m ust contain common principles. (1977: 23)
Harman's argument clashes, first of all, with the linguistic usage. Why
have people used the word sign for more than two thousand years to
d efi ne phenomena which should be divided into three diffe re nt
categories? Second , Harman's objection goes against the consensus gentium
of the philosophical tradition. From the Stoics to the Middle Ages, from
Locke to Peirce, from Husser! to Wittgenstein, there has been a constant attempt to find a common basis for the theory of linguistic meaning
and for the theory of pictorial representation, and also for the theory of
meaning and the theory of inference.
Finally, the obj ection goes against a philosophical instinct, very
adequately summarized by Aristotle in terms of the 'wonder' which induces persons to philosophize. What is the 'meaning' of the expression
at home I have ten cats? Is it its propositional content or what can be
inferred from the fact that I have ten cats? One could answer that the
second phenomenon has nothing to do with linguistic meaning, si nce it
belongs to the universe of proofs which can be articulated by using the
facts represented by the propositions. Yet, is the antecedent evoked by
language so easily separable from the language which represented it?
When we examine the problem of the Stoic semeion (UTJJ-tELOV), we shall
see how ambiguous and inextricable is the relationship among a fact, the
proposition which represents it, and the sentence which expresses that
proposition. In any event, what makes the two problems difficult to
separate is precisely the fact that in both cases aliquid stat pro aliquo. The
manner of standing for may vary, yet we still face a peculiar dialectic of
presence and absence in both cases. Is this not a good enough reason to
ask whether a common mechanism, however deep, might govern both
phenomena? 
[ZO] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
A man wears a badge with a Hammer and Sickle at his buttonhole.
Are we facing a case of 'intended meaning' (the man wants to say that he
is a Com munist), of pictorial representation ( the badge represents 'symbolically' the union of workers and peasants), or of inferential proof (if
he wears the badge, then he must be a Com munist)? The same event
falls within the scope of what Harman sees as three different categories.
It is true that the same phenomenon can be the objet:t of quite different
theories: the badge can be studied by inorganic chemistry in terms of the
material of which it is made, by physics in terms of its being subjected to
gravitational laws, by economics in terms of its being an industrial product which is bought and sold. But, in our case, the badge is the object of
the three (presumed) theories of meaning, of representation and of evidence only inasmuch as it does not stand for itself. It does not stand for its
molecular composition, its tendency to fall down, its capability of being
packaged and transported. It stands for something which is outside itself. In this sense it gives rise to wonder, and it becomes the same
abstract object of the same theoretical question.
1.5. The deconstruction of the linguistic sign
The following critiques have characteristics in common: first, when they
speak of sign in general and consider other kinds of signs, they point to
the structure of the linguistic sign. Second , they tend to dissolve the sign
into entities of greater or lesser purport.
1.5.1. Sign vs. figura
As an entity, the sign is too large . Phonology's work on li nguistic
signifiers , seen as the result of the articulation of lesser phonological
units, starts out with the Stoic's discovery of the stoicheia (urotxeia), it
reaches maturity with Hjelmslev's postulating the existence of figurae,
and is crowned by Jakobson's theory of distinc tive features. This
theoretical achievement does not in itself question the notion of linguistic sign, but with Hjelmslev there arises the possibility of identifying
figurae at the content level as well:
If, for example, a mechanical inventory at a given stage o f t h e procedure
leads to a registration of the entities of content 'ram' , 'ewe', 'man', 'woman' , 'boy' , 'girl' , 'stallion' , ' mare' , 'sheep' , 'human bei ng' , 'child' , 'horse' ,
'he' , and 'she' - then 'ram', 'ewe' , 'man' , 'woman' , 'boy' , 'girl' , 'stallion' ,
and 'mare' must be eliminated from the inventory of elements if they can be
explained univocally as relational units that include only 'he' or 'she' on the
one hand, and 'sheep' , 'human being' , 'child', 'horse' , on the other.
(1943 : 70) 
Signs [2 1]
The discovery of a content articulation leads Hjelmslev to argue that
languages cannot be described as pure sign systems:
By the aims usually attributed to them they are first and foremost sign systems; but by their internal structu re they are first and foremost something
different, namely, systems of figuroe that can be used to construct signs.
The definition of a language as a sign system has thus shown itself, on
closer analysis, to be unsatisfactory. It concerns only the external functions
of a language, its relation to the nonlinguistic factors that surround it, but
not its proper, internal functions. (Ibid., p. 47)
The sign (or the sign-function) appears, therefore, as the manifest and
recognizable end of a net of aggregations and disintegrations constantly
open to further combinations. The linguistic sign is not a unit of the
system of signification; it is, rather, a detectable unit in the process of
communication.
Despite being invaluable for the whole development of structural
semantics, Hjelmslev's proposal does not account for other kinds of signs
in which it appears that the two functives are not analyzable further into
figuroe. If the cloud which announces the storm and the portrait of the
Mona Lisa are to be taken as signs, there must be signs without expression figuroe, and perhaps withou t content figuroe as well. Prieto (1966)
has decidely widened the field of sign analysis by showing the existence
of systems without articulation, and systems which have only a first articulation. The white stick of the blind - a positive presence which
constitu tes i tself as pertinent against the absence of the stick, as a
signifier without articulations - represents blindness in general , requesting the right of way, postulating understanding on the part of
bystanders. In short, it conveys a content nebula. As a system the stick is
quite simple (presence vs. absence), but its com municational use is very
complex. If the stick is not a sign, what is it, and what should it be
called ?
1 .5.2. Signs vs. sentences
In the same years which saw Hjelmslev's critique of the sign format as
too broad , B uyssens maintained that the format of the sign was too
minute. The semantic unit is not the sign , but something corresponding
to the sentence, which Buyssens calls seme. The example given by Buyssens concerns street signs as well as linguistic signs. He maintains that
an arrow, isolated from the context of the street sign, does not allow for
the concretization of a "state of consciousness." In order to perform this
function it will have to have a certain color, a certain orientation, and it
will have to appear on a specific street sign , placed in a specific location.
"The same thing happens with the isolated word , for instance, the word 
[22] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
table. This word appeared as the potential mem ber of different sentences
in which different things are talked about" (Buyssens 1 943 : 38).
Stiange opposition: Hjelmslev is uninterested in the sign because he
is interested in language as an abstract system; Buyssens is uninterested
in the sign because he is interested in communication as a concrete act.
Obviously, the opposition extension vs. intension is in the background
of this debate. Unpleasant homonymy: componential semantics will call
Hjelmslev's content figurae (smaller than the sign) 'semes', while the
tradition which developed from B uyssens (Prieto, De Mauro) will use
the term 'seme' for utterances larger than the sign.
In any case, Buyssens' seme is what others will call sentence or a
performed speech act. What is surprising is the initial statement by
Buyssens, according to which a sign does not have meaning. If it is true
that nominantur singularia sed universalia significantur, one should rather
say that the word table by itself does not name (it does not refer to)
anything, but has a meaning, which Hjelmslev could have subdivided
into figurae. Buyssens admits that this word (like the arrow) can be a
potential member of different phrases. What is there, then, in the content of table which allows it to enter expressions such as dinner is on the
table or the table is made of wood, and not in expressions such as the table
eats the fish or he washed his face with the dinner table? It must be agreed,
then, that precisely because of its susceptibility to analysis by content
figurae, the word table must include both atomic units of content and
contextual instructions ruling over the word's capacity to enter linguistic
segments larger than the sign .
Prieto (1975 : 27) clarified this a pparent disagree ment between
Hjelmslev and Buyssens by stating that the seme (for Buyssens) is a
functional unit, whereas the figura is an economic unit. Hjelmslev postulated the sign as a functional unit and the figura as an economic unit.
The problem is to identify, not two, but three or more levels, where the
lower level is always constituted as the economic unit of the upper
level's functional unit.
B uyssens' distinction certainly anticipates, with its concreteness and
complexity, all the theories opposing to the sign the speech act. However, Plato and Aristotle, the Stoics and the Sophists had already talked
about the differences existing between the meaning of words and the
pragmatic nature of the question, the prayer, and the order. Those who
oppose a pragmatics of discourse to a semantics of sign units shift the attention from the systems of signification to the process of communication
(Eco 1 976); but the two perspectives are actually complementary. One
cannot think of the sign without seeing it in some way characterized by
its contextual destiny, but at the same time it is difficult to explain why
a certain speech act is understood unless the nature of the signs which it
contextualizes is explained. 
Signs
1.5.3· The sign as difference
[23]
The elements of the signifier are set into a system of oppositions in
which, as Saussure explained, there are only differences. The same
thing happens with the signified . In the famous example given by
Hjelmslev (1943 : 39), the difference in the content of two apparently
synonymous terms, /Holz/ and /bois/, is given by the different segmentation of the continuum. The German /Holz/ encompasses everything
which is not /Baum/ and is not /Wald/. The correlation between
expression-plane and content-plane is also given by a difference: the
sign-function exists by a dialectic of presence and absence, as a mutual
exchange between two heterogeneities. Starting from this structural
premise, one can dissolve the entire sign system into a net of fractures.
The nature of the sign is to be found in the 'wound' or 'opening' or
'divarication' which constitutes it and annuls it at the same time.
This idea, although vigorously developed by poststructuralist thought,
that of Derrida in particular, was actually developed much earlier. In the
short text De organo sive arte cogitandi, Leibniz, searching for a restricted
number of thoughts from whose combination all the others could be derived (as is the case with numbers), locates the essential combinational
matrix in the opposition between God and nothing, presence and absence. The binary system of calculation is the wondrous likeness of this
dialectics.
From a metaphysical perspective, it may be fascinating to see every
oppositional structure as based on a constitutive difference which dissolves the different terms. Still, in order to conceptualize an oppositional
system where something is perceived as absent, something else must be
postulated as present, at least potentially. The presence of one element is
necessary for the absence of the other. All observations concerning the importance of the absent element hold symmetrically for the present element
as well. All observations concerning the constitutive function of difference hold for the poles from whose opposition the difference is generated . The argument is, therefore, an autophagous one. A phoneme is no
doubt an abstract position within a system, and it acquires its value only
because of the other phonemes to which it is opposed . Yet, for an 'ernie'
unit to be recognized, it must be formulated somehow as 'etic' . In other
words, phonology builds up a system of oppositions in order to explain
the functioning of a number of phonetic presences which, if they do not
exist prior to the system, nonetheless are associated with i ts ghost.
Without people uttering sounds, phonology could not exist, but without
the system postulated by phonology, people could not distinguish between sounds. Types are recognized through, their realizations into concrete tokens. One cannot speak of a form (of the expression or of the
content) without presupposing a matter and li nking it i mmediately
(neither before nor after) to a substance. 
[24] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILO!iOPHY OF LANGUAGE
1.5-4- The predominance of the signifier
The answer given to the preceding question could confirm a further
critique of the notion of sign. If the sign can be known only through the
signifier and if the signified emerges only through an act of perpetual
su bstitution of the signifer, the semiotic chain appears to be just a 'chain
of signifiers' . As such, it could be manipulated even by the unconscious
(if we take the unconscious as being li nguistically constituted). By the
'drift' of signifiers, other signifiers are produced . As a more or less direct
consequence of these conclusions, the universe of signs and even of
sentences would dissolve into d iscourse as an activity. This line of
thought, derived from Lacan, has generated a number of varied, but
essentially related, positions.
The basis for this critique is actually a misunderstanding, a wordplay.
Only by substituting 'signified' every time 'signifier' appears, does the
discourse of these theoreticians become comprehensible. The misunderstanding derives from the fact that every signifier can only be translated into another signifier and that only by this process of interpretation
can one grasp the 'corresponding signified' . It must be clear, though,
that in none of various displacement and condensation processes described by F reu d - however m u ltiplied and al most automatic the
generative and drifting mechanisms might appear- does the interplay
(even if based on assonances, alliterations, likeness of expression) fail to
reverberate im mediately on the aggregation of the content units, actually
determining the content. In the Freudian passage from /Herr-signore/ to
/Signorelli/, a series of expression differences is at work, based on identities and progressive slidings of the content. The Freudian example
can, in fact, be understood only by someone who knows both German
and Italian, seeing words as complete sign-functions (expression + content). A person who does not know Chinese cannot prod uce Freudian
slips interpretable in Chinese, unless a psychoanalyst who knows
Chinese demonstrates that his or her patient had displaced linguistic remembrances and that he or she unconsciously played with Chinese expressions. A Freudian slip, in order to make sense, plays on content
figurae; if it plays only with expression figurae it amounts to a mechanical
error ( typographical or phonetic). This kind of mechanical error is likely
to involve content elements only in the eye of the interpreter. But in
this case it is the interpreter who must be psychoanalyzed.
1.5·5· Sign vs. text
The so-called signifying chain produces texts which carry with them the
recollection of the intertextuality which nourishes them. Texts generate,
or are capable of generating, multiple (and ultimately infi nite) readings
and interpretations. It was argued, for instance, by the later Barthes, by 
Signs [25]
the recent Derrida, and by Kristeva, that signification is to be located
exclusively in the text. The text is the locus where meaning is produced
and becomes productive (signifying practice). Within its texture, the
signs of the dictionary (as codifying equivalences) can emerge only by a
rigidification and death of all sense. This critical line takes up Buyssens'
argu ment (communication is given only at the level of sentence), but it
goes deeper. A text is not simply a communicational apparatus. It is a
device which questions the previous signifying systems, often renews
them, and sometimes destroys them. Finnegans Wake - a textual machine
made to liquidate grammars and dictionaries - is exe mplary in this
sense, but even rhetorical figures are produced and become alive only at
the textual level. The textual machine empties the terms which the literal dictionary deemed univocal and well defined , and fills them with
new content figures. Yet, the production of a metaphor such as the king of
the forest (where a figure of humanity is added to lions and an animal
property reverberates on the class of kings) implies the existence of both
/king/ and /lion/ as functives of two previously codified sign-functions.
If signs (expressio ns and content) did not preexist the text, every
metaphor would be equivalent simply to saying that something is something. But a metaphor says that that (linguistic) thing is at the same time
something else.
The ability of the textual manifestations to empty, destroy, or reconstruct pre-existing sign-functions depends on the presence within the
sign-function (that is, in the network of content figures) of a set of instructions oriented toward the (potential) prod uction of different texts.
(This concept will be further developed in 1 . 9. ) It is in this sense that
the thematization of textuality has been particul arly suggestive.
1.5.6 The sign as identity
The sign is supposed to be based on the categories of 'similitude' or
'identity' . This presumed fallacy renders the sign coherent with the
ideological notion of the subject. The subject as a presupposed transcendental unity which opens itself to the world (or to which the world
opens) through the act of representation, as well as the subject that
transfers its representations onto other subjects in the process of communication, is supposedly a philosophical fiction dominating all of the
history of philosophy. Let us postpone the discussion of this objection
and see now in what sense the notion of sign is seen to be coherent with
the (no longer viable) notion of subject:
Under the mask of socialization or of mechanistic realism, ideological linguistics, absorbed by the science of signs, turns the sign-subject into a center. The sign-subject becomes the beginning and the end of all translin-
[26] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
guistic actiVIty; it becomes closed up in itself, located in its own word,
which is conceived of by positivism as a kind of 'psychism' residing in the
brain. (Kristeva 1969: 69)
· The statement above implies the identification of the sign with the linguistic
sign, where the linguistic sign is based on the equivalence model: p = q.
In point of fact, Kristeva defines the sign as "resemblance" :
The sign brings separate instances (subject-object on one hand, subjectinterlocutor on the other) back to a unified whole (a unity which presents
itself as a sentence-message), replacing praxis with a single meaning, and
difference with resemblance . . . . The relationship instituted by the sign will
therefore be a reconciliation of discrepancies, and identification of diff erences.
(Ibid., pp. 70, 84)
It seems, however, that such a criticism can apply only to a degenerate
notion of linguistic sign, rooted on the equivalence model. The problem
is to see whether and to what extent this notion has ever been supported
by the most mature theories of signs. For instance, the notion of sign as
resemblance and identity does not appear in Peirce: "A sign is something by knowing which we know something more" (C. P. 8. 332). The
sign is an instruction for interpretation, a mechanism which starts from
an initial stimulus and leads to all its illative consequences. Starting from
the sign, one goes through the whole semiotic process and arrives at the
point where the sign becomes capable of contradicting itself (otherwise,
those textual mechanisms called 'literature' would not be possible). For
Peirce, the sign is a potential proposition (as even Kristeva [ 1974: 43]
notes). In order to comprehend this notion of sign, we need to reconsider the initial phase of its historical development. Such reconsideration
requires the elimination of an embarrassing notion, that of linguistic
sign . Since this notion is after all a late cultural product, we shall
postpone its treatment until later.
1 .6. Signs vs. words
The term which the Western philosophical tradition has translated as
signum was originally the Greek semelon (u'Tip.iiov). It appeared as a
technical-philosophical term in the fifth century, with Parmenides and
Hippocrates. It is often found as a synonym of tekmerion (TEKf.LTJpLov:
proof, clue, symptom). A first distinction between the two terms appears
only with Aristotle's Rhetoric.
Hippocrates took the notion of clue from the physicians who came
before him. Alcmeon said that "the Gods have immediate knowledge of
invisible and mo rtal things, but men must 'proceed by clues' 
Signs [27]
(TEKf.Laipe6iJat)" (D. K. , BI). The Cnidarian physicians knew the value
of symptoms. Apparently, they codified them in the form of equivalences. Hippocrates maintained that the symptom is equivocal if it is not
analyzed contextually, taking into account the air, the water, the environment, the general state of the body, and the regimen which is
likely to modify the situation. Such a model functions as if to say: if p
then q, but only with the concurrence of factors y and .z. A code exists,
but it is not a univocal one.
Hippocrates was not interested in linguistic signs. In any event, it
appears that at the time the term 'sign' was not applied to words. A word
was a name (onoma, ' 6vof.La). Parmenides made use of this difference
when he opposed the truth of the thought concerning Being to the illusory
nature of opinions and the fallacy of sensations. Now, if representations
are deceptive, names are nothing but equally deceptive levels superimposed on the objects that we think we know. Onoma.zein (' Ovof.La,etv) is
always used by Parmenides in order to give an arbitrary name, which is
deemed to be true but does not actually correspond to the truth. The
name establishes a pseudoequivalence with reality, and in doing so it
conceals it. On the other hand, Parmenides uses the term 'signs' (semata:
UTJf.LlXTa} When he speaks of evidence, of an inferential principle: "That
Being exists, there are signs" (D. K. , B8. 2).
With Plato and Aristotle words are analyzed from a double point of
view: (a) the difference between signifier and signified and (b) the
difference between signification and reference. Signification (that is, meaning) says what a thing is, and in this sense it is a function performed also
by single terms; in the act of reference one says, on the contrary, that a
thing is, and in this sense reference is a function performed only by
complete sentences. Throughout his whole work on logic and language,
Aristotle is reluctant to use the term sign (semeion ) for words.
At first glance, contrary evidence is provided by the well-known page
of De lnterpretatione, 1 6a, where it seems that it is said that words are
signs. But this page requires some careful interpretation. First, Aristotle
says that both spoken and written words are symbols (crof.Lf3o'A.a) of the
affections of the soul. Then he says that spoken and written words are
not the same for all human beings, since (as it is restated in 1 6a20- 30)
they are posited by convention. In this sense, words are different from
the sounds emitted by animals. Words are conventional and arbitrary,
whereas other kinds of sounds are natural and motivated. It is evident
that Aristotle reserves the term symbol for spoken and written words (see
also Di Cesare 1 981 and Lieb 1 981).
It must be noticed that symbol was at that time, as a philosophical
term, more neutral than sign. The notion of sign was already introduced
and discussed by the Hippocratic tradition as a precise category, whereas 
[28] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
symbol was generally used as « token» or « identification mark» (see Chapter 4 of this book).
On the same page (16a.5), Aristotle says that the affections of the soul
are likenesses, or i mages, or copies of things, and as such they cannot be
studied in a logical (linguistic) framework. Therefore they will be dealt
with in De Anima. In stressing this difference between mental images
and words, he states, incidentally, that spoken and written words are
signs (semela) of the affections of the soul. Thus prima facie he equates
signs with symbols.
One could object that in this context sign is used in a metaphorical
way. But one should make a more radical remark. If Aristotle was following the terminological criterion he also follows in Rhetoric, /signs/ still
means « proof» , <<clue», <<symptom» . If this is true, he is thus saying that
words (spoken or written) are the proof that one has something in one's
mind to express; at the same time he is stating that, even though words
are symptoms of mental affections, this does not mean that they have
the same semiotic and psychological status of these affections.
This interpretive hypothesis is reinforced by the way in which Aristotle (I6b. 1 9ff) wonders whether verbs as to be or not to be are signs of the
existence of the thing. His line of thought is the following: (a) outside
the sentence , no verb can state that something really exists or actually
does something; (b) verbs can perform this function only in a complete
assertive sentence; (c) not even to be or not to be, uttered in isolation,
assert the existence of something; (d) however, when they are inserted
into a sentence, they are signs (or, as some translators interpret, "they
are indicative of the fact" ) that the existence of something is asserted.
Such an interpretation is confirmed by what Aristotle has previously said
(16b.Sff), namely, that a verb is always the sign (or that it is indicative of
the fact) that something is said or asserted of something. Aquinas, in his
com mentary on De lnterpretatione, lucidly analyzes this passage . He excludes, however, a reading that could sound very attractive to a contemporary mind, that is, that the verb is the signifier of which a predication
is the signified , or that the sentence that contains the verb is the vehicle
of an assertive proposition. On the contrary, Aquinas chooses a more
commonsensical reading: the presence of the verb within a sentence is
the proof, the symptom that this sentence asserts the existence of something by actually predicating something of something.
Thus we are entitled to understand that, when Aristotle incidentally
uses the term sign for words, he is simply stressing that even words can
be taken as symptoms. He is not equating linguistic sym bols with natural signs. He is only saying that sometimes symbols can be taken as proofs.
But symbols are different from other natural signs because, when they
function primarily as symbols (independently of their possible use as
proofs), they are not based on the model of inference but on the model 
Signs [29]
of equivalence . Aristotle was in fact the first to insist that linguistic terms
are equivalent to their definitions and that word and definition are fully
reciprocable (as we shall see in Chapter 2 of this book).
The sign makes its appearance in the Rhetoric, where the enthymemes
are said to be derived from verisimilitudes (eikota: ElKoTa) and from signs
(semefa). But the signs are divided into two logically well-differential
categories. The first type of sign has a specific name, tekmerion, in the
sense of 'evidence' . We can translate it as necessary sign; if one has a
fever, then one is ill; if a woman has milk, then she has given birth. The
necessary sign can be translated into the universal statement 'all those
who have a fever are ill' . It must be noted that this statement does not
establish a relation of equivalence ( biconditional). One can be ill (for
instance, with an ulcer) without having a fever.
The second type of sign, says Aristotle, does not have a specific name.
We could call it a weak sign: if one has difficulty in breathing, then one
has a fever. The conclusion is obviously only probable, because the difficulty in breathing could be caused by excessive physical exercise.
Transformed into a premise, the sign would o nly give a particular
affirmative: 'some people have difficulty in breathing and they have a
fever' (the logical form is one of conjunction rather than implication).
The weak sign is such just because the necessary sign does not establish
an equivalence. A weak sign can be produced by converting the universal affirmative - into which the necessary sign has been tu rned - into
a particular affirmative. The subordinate of 'all those who have a fever
are ill' yields in terms of a logical square, 'there are some people who are
ill and who have a fever' , which in fact is a weak sign and permits - at
most - an induction.
Actually, Aristotle is uneasy with these different types of signs. He
knows the apodictic syllogism, but he does not know, at least not with
theoretical clarity, the hypothetical syllogism, that is, the p ::J q form
which will be the glory of the Stoics. For this reason Aristotle traces
argumentative schemes, but he does not dwell on their logical form.
1 .7. The Stoics
The Stoics also (from what can be gathered of their quite complex
semiotics) do not seem to in tegrate clearly their theory of language and
their theory of signs. In verbal language, they distinguish clearly between semafnon (<TTJJLaivov: expression), semainomenon (<TTJJLaLVOJLEVOV:
content), and tynchanon (nryxcivov: referent). They seem to reproduce
the triad suggested by Plato and Aristotle, but they rework it with a
theoretical subtlety lacking in m any of those who have today reinvented
such a semantic triangle.
The Stoics analyze the m ultiple articulation of the expression and dis-
[30] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
tinguish the simple sound emitted by the larynx and the articulatory
muscles (an as-yet-inarticulate sound) from the articulate linguistic element
and from the actual word which exists only insofar as it is related or
relatable to a content. Such a model functions as if to say, with Saussure,
that the linguistic sign is a twofold entity. Augustine, in the wake of the
Stoics, will call dictio that verbum vocis which foris sonat, being at the
same time perceived and recognized because it is related to a verbum
mentis or cordis. The Stoics thought that the barbarians were able to perceive the physical sound , but unable to recognize it as a word . This
happened, not because the barbarians lacked the corresponding mental
image, but because they did not know the correlational rule. In this
respect, the Stoics go much further than their predecessors and discover
the provisional and unstable nature of the sign-fu nction (the same content can make up a word with an expression of a different language).
With Stoics, the content ceases to be, as it was with their predecessors, an affection of the soul, a mental i mage, a perception, a thought or
an idea. It is neither an idea in the Platonic sense, since the Stoics have
a materialistic metaphysics, nor an idea in the psychological sense, since
even in this case the content would be a body, a physical fact, an alteration of the soul (which is also a body), a seal impressed u pon the mind.
Instead , the Stoics s uggest that the content is an 'incorporeal' .
The void , location, and time are incorporeals, as well as spatial relations, chronological sequences, actions, and events. The incorporeals are
not things, they are states, modes of being. Geometric surfaces and the
thinnest section of the cone are incorporeals. lncorporeals are entia rationis insofar as every ens rationis is a relationship, a way of looking at
things. Among the incorporeals the Stoics put the lekton (AEKrov), which
has been translated as 'expressible' , dictum, or dicible. The /ekton is a
semiotic category. The fact of Dion walking is, in the moment of its
expression, a /ekton.
The first problem is the relationship between the semainomenon and
the lekton. If ' Dion walks' is a proposition (and, therefore, an incorporeal), are ' Dion' and 'walks' also incorporeals? Sextus E mpiricus identifies semainomenon and lekton as synonyms (Adv. Math. 8. 1 2); however,
the solution appears to be more complex. The Stoics talk of complete
and incomplete lekta. The complete lekton is a proposition, whereas the
incomplete lekta are parts, pieces of propositions which are combined
into the proposition through a series of syntactical links. The subject and
the predicate are listed among the incomplete lekta. They appear to be
grammatical and lexical categories and , therefore, categories of the expression, but in point of fact they are categories of the content. The
subject (which is the usual translation of the word ptosis, 7TTW<Ttc;o) represents the uppermost example of case, because the attention devoted to
assertive propositions caused the subject to be seen as the case par excel-
Signs [31]
lence. But the case is not the inflection form (a grammatical category
that expresses the case). Rather, it is the expressed or expressible content.
Today we would say that it is a pure actantial position. In this sense, the
subject, principal example of incomplete /ekton, is an incorporeal. The
Stoics, therefore , had already de-psychologized seman tics, so that we
can translate semainomenon as "content" in Hjelmslev's sense, that is, as
a position within a system, the result of an abstract segmentation of the
noetic field, a cultural unit (rather than a mental image, a thought, or an
engram).
When the Stoics speak of the signs (semeia), they seem to refer to
something immediately evident which leads to some conclusions about
the existence of something not immediately evident. The sign can be
commemorative: in this case it derives from an association, confirmed by
preceding experience, between two events. On the basis of past experience I know that, if there is s moke, then there must be fire. But the
s ign can also be indicative. In this case it points to something which has
never been evident and probably will never be, such as the motions of
the body which signify the motions of the soul, or the bodily humors
which by passing through the skin indicate that there must be perceptible (but unperceived) pores. In all these cases, the signs seem to be
physical events: the smoke, the presence of milk revealing birth, the
light revealing the day, and so on. Yet, the fact that the events, the
transitory state of the bodies, are called i ncorporeals should give us
pause. Sextus E mpiricus, in fact, does acknowledge that the sign from
which the i nference is derived is not the physical eve nt, but the
proposition which expresses it. The sign is the "antecedent proposition
within a valid and larger hypothetical premise which serves the purpose
of revealing its consequent" (Adv. Math. 7.245) or "a true antecedent
proposition within a true condition, serving the purpose of revealing its
consequent" (Hyp. Pyrrh. 2. 1 04).
The Stoic model of sign assu mes, therefore , the form of the inference
(p ::J q), where the variables are neither physical realities nor events, but
the propositions that express the events. A column of s moke is not a sign
u nless the interpreter sees the event as the true antecedent of a
hypothetical reasoning (if there is s moke ... ) which is related by inference ( more or less necessary) to its consequent ( ... then there is fire).
This is why the Stoics can say, and they do, that the sign is a lekton and,
therefore, an incorporeal. The sign is not concerned with that smoke and
that fire, but with the possibility of a relationship between antecedent
and c0nsequent regulating of any occurrence of the s moke (and of the
fire). The sign is type, not occurrence.
By now it is clear how, in the Stoics' semiotics, the theory of language
becomes rightfully associated with the theory of signs. In order to have
signs, propositions must be formulated, and the propositions must be 
[32] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
organized according to a logical syntax which is reflected and made possible by the linguistic syntax (see Frede 1 978). Signs emerge only insofar
as they are rationally expressible through the elements of language .
Language is articulated inasmuch as it expresses meaningful events. It
must be stressed that the Stoics do not still say that words are signs (at
most they say that words serve as vehicles for types of signs). The lexical
difference between the couple semafnon/semainomenon and the semefon
remains. But the common and obvious e tymological root is an indication
of their relatedness. We could have the Stoics say, as Lotman does, that
language is a primary modeling system, through which the other systems
are expressed.
Referring once again to contemporary theories (see also Todorov
1 977), we could then say that the linguistic term and the natural sign are
constituted by a double relation of signification, a double elevation translatable into the Hjelmslevian model of connotation (in the diagram form
popularized by Barthes; see Figure I. 1 ).
The word /smoke/ refers to a portion of content segmentation which
we will conventionally designate as «smoke». At this point, we have
three alternatives, whether intensional or extensional: (a) «Smoke» connotes « fire» on the basis of an encyclopedia-like representation which
takes into account metonymic relationships of effect-to-cause (a case
grammar accounting for 'actants' like Cause or Agent can represent
rather well this sort of meaning postulate); (b) the sentence /there is
smoke/ expresses as its content the proposition « there is smoke» which,
always by virtue of an underlying encyclopedic representation including
frames or scripts (see 3.2 of this book), suggests as a reasonable inference « there is fire» (notice that we are still at an intensional level, since
the possibility of the inference is coded among the properties of smoke,
independently of any actual world experience); (c) in a process of reference to states of the actual world the proposition «there is smoke••, on
the grounds of the aforementioned meaning postulates, leads to the indexical proposition « therefore here there is fire», to be evaluated in terms
of truth values.
When I perceive a cloud or a column of smoke as mere physical
events, they do not differ from any sound which I can perceive without
attributing a semantic relevance to it (as the barbarian does). But if, on
the basis of a preexisting rule, I know that smoke in general refers to
fire, then I make the event pertinent as a single expression of a more
general content, and the smoke I perceived becomes the perceptive content « Smoke » . This first movement, from the sensation to the perception invested with meaning, is so immediate that we tend to consider it
as semiotically irrelevant. Gnoseology has always questioned precisely
this presumed immediacy of sensation and perception.

Even according to the medieval perspective, simplex apprehensio, that
is, the first operation of the intellect, allows one to grasp the thing in its
essence through the phantasm, but it is only by the act ofjudgment, that
is, the second operation of the intellect, that the thing is recognized and
viewed as relevant for the purpose of further predications. It is not by
chance that gnoseology talks of the perceptive meaning where the term
'meaning' seems at once a semantic category and a category of the
phenomenology of perception. Actually, in order to grasp, from a series
of sensory data, the form 'smoke' , I must already be directed by the
belief that smoke is relevant to the making of further infere nces.
Otherwise , the smoke provided for me by the sensation remains a
potential perception which I have not yet make pertinent as smoke, but
as mist, miasma, or as any exhalation which is not caused by combustion. Only if I already know the general rule which makes for 'if smoke,
then fire' am I able to render the sensory datum meaningful, by seeing it
as that smoke which can reveal fire.
1 .8. Unification of the theories and predominance of linguistics
Some centuries later, in De Magistro, Augustine will definitely bring together the theory of signs and the theory of language . Fifteen centuries
before Saussure, he will be the one to recognize the genus of signs, of
which linguistic signs are a species, such as insignias, gestures, ostensive
signs. But in so doing Augustine delivers to the tradition that follows
him a problem that not even the Stoics had clearly solved . Augustine
had actually provided a solution, but he had failed to stress it sufficiently
to make it indispu table. The Stoics had left unresolved the problem of
the difference between the relation of linguistics expression to content
on the one hand (what Hjelmslev will call denotation) and the relation of
sign-proposition to consequent meaning on the other. One suspects that
the first level may still be based on equivalence, while the second is
doubtlessly based on inference ( Figure 1.2).
However, we must ask whether or not this difference is based on a
curious 'optical illusion' . From the moment in which Augustine introd uces verbal language among signs, language starts to appear in an awkward position. Being too strong, too finely articulated and therefore sci-
[34] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
E c

FIGURE 1.2
e ntifically analyzable (and the work of the Hellenistic grammarians must
be kept in mind in this respect), language could hardly be the object of a
theory of signs born in order to describe the relationship between natu ral
events, so elusive and generic (and we will see how much the Stoics'
inference was epistemologically open to a continuum of relationships of
necessity and weakness). Since language was i ncreasingly believed to be
the semiotic system which could be analyzed with the most profit (a
careful study of this aspect of the history of semiotics would be very
worthwhile) and the system which could serve as a model for all other
systems ( translating every other semiotic onto the plane of its content),
the model of the linguistic sign gradually came to be seen as the semiotic
model par excellence.
By the time this conclusion was reached ( the definitive sanction took
place with Saussure), the linguistic model was crystallized into its 'flattest' form, the one e ncouraged by the dictionaries and, unfortunately, by
a lot of formal logic which had to fill its empty symbols only for the sake
of exemplification as well. As a consequence, the notion of meaning as
synonymy and as essential definition began to develop.
/Man/ is equivalent to «rational animal>> in certain contexts, but certainly not in the expression /mom, there is a man with a package to
deliver/, where the content •• man>> can be analyzed according to many
properties (male, u nknown, human being, person of a low social extraction, even foreign presence or threat), but certainly nol as a rational
animal. Aristotle delivered to us the principle of (biconditional) equivalence between term and definition by genus and species because he
worked only on categorematic terms to be inserted within assertive propositions. The Stoics, on the other hand (see Frede 1 978; Graeser 1 978),
thought that every syntactic category had its semantic counterpart, including
syncategorematic terms. If the complete lektti derived from the combination of incomplete ones, they had also to include conjunctions, articles,
and pronouns. Augustine later shows that even prepositions have meaning.
1.9. The 'instructional' model
In De Magistro 2, Augustine analyzes with Adeodatus the verse by Virgil
"Si nihil ex tanto superis placet urbi relinqui," and defines the eight words
as "octo signa." He then proceeds to analyze the meaning of lsi! and to 
Signs [35]
I
point out that this term conveys a meaning of « doubt». And since he
knows that non esse signum nisi aliquid significet, he is forced to define the
meaning (certainly not the referent! ) of /nihil/. Granting that it is impossible to produce signs which do not say anything, and since the
meaning of /nothing/ does not seem to be either an object or a state of
the world, Augustine concludes that this term expresses an affection of the
soul, that is, the state of mind which, although not recognizing something, recognizes at least its absence.
Augustine then goes on to ask what lex/ means. He refuses to accept
the synonymical answer, according to which lex/ would mean «de». This
synonym is an interpretation that m ust in turn be interpreted. The conclusion is that lex/ means a kind of separation (secretionem quondam) from
that i'o which something was included. Augustine adds a further instruction for contextual decoding: the word can express separation from
something which has ceased to exist, as when the city cited in the line
by Virgil disappeared, or it can express separation from something which
still exists, as when one says that some merchants are coming from (ex)
Rome.
The meaning of a syncategorematic term is, therefore, a set (a series, a
system) of instructions for its possible contextual insertions and for its
different semantic outputs in different contexts (all registered by the code).
Can this solution apply to categorematic terms as well? This is, in
point of fact, the solution i ncreasingly preferred by context-oriented
componential semantics. The forerunners of this type of instructional
semantics were Peirce's logic of relatives (C. P. 2. 379, 3. 66; see also E co
1 979), the various case grammars ( Fillmore 1 968; B ierwisch 1 970, 1 971),
the semantic models based on contextual and circumstantial selections
(Eco 1 976, 2. 1 1 ), and their reformulation for the disambiguation of the
metaphor (see Chapters 2 and 3 of this book). The semantic type is the
description of the contexts in which the term can be expected to occur.
If this is the case, then the connoted meaning is possible because, at
the first level of signification (where the linguistic sign is primarily at
work), inference, rather than mere equivalence, is already present. A
linguistic term appears to be based on pure equivalence simply because
we do not recognize in it a 'sleeping' inference.
The process of recognition of natural events which generates signproposition takes place in the same manner. Perception is always interrogative and conditional and is invariably based (even if we do not
realize it) on a bet. If certain perceptual data are present, then (there is)
perhaps smoke, as long as other contextual elements authorize me to
think that the perceptual interpretation is appropriate. Peirce was aware
of the fact that perception is always presumptive evidence, a source of
potential semiosis. The fact that perception takes place without effort
does not invalidate its inferential mechanism (see C. P. 5. 266- 68). 
[36] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
We are left 'fith the problem of the so-called substitutional tables, that
is, minimal ciphers where tfie content-plane is given by the expression-plane of another semiotic system. In Morse code, for instance,
/. - I = «a», and vice versa, with complete reciprocity. A substitutional
table could be viewed as a degraded semiotic system, but in point of fact
equivalence appears to be a 'sleeping' inference here as well (see Chapter 7 of this book).
Therefore, there is no difference in the semiotic structure of first- and
second-level signification (we use this distinction because the couple
denotation/connotation is equivocal , since 'denotation' is used by extensional semantic theories in order to refer to truth-values). The f_luctuating obj ect, which is commonly called 'sign' in so many different
cases, exists as a scientifically unified object, constructed by the discipline
which studies it, subsuming different phenomena under the same formal
scheme p :::> q.
What varies according to the phenomena is the cogency of the inference. If (there is) the first, then ( there is) the second. But what is the
episte mological value of if and then ?
1.10. Strong codes and weak codes
The Stoics' inference was the Philonian one, the material inference of
modern logic. As such, it did not deal with the epistemological value of
the link between antecedent and consequent. The Stoics gave various
examples: 'if there is daytime, then there is light' is an equivalence
(biconditional). 'If it is daytime, then Dion walks' is an example of material inference devoid of epistemological value . 'If she gives milk, then
she has given birth' is an inference from effect to cause based on previous inductions. 'If a torch is seen, then the enemy is coming' seems to
be a very vague supposition, because the torch could be carried by
friends as well . Sextus interprets this sign as a conventional one, supposing that it is recognized on the basis of a previous agreement. At this
point, the epistemological value would depend on social laws rather than
on natural laws. By introducing, along with the example, all the commemorative signs among those founded on an arbitrary correlation, Sextus acknowledges the inferential nature of conventional signs. In this
case, the epistemological value of if-then assumes the legalistic nature of
the norms sanctioned by juridical codes.
Aristotle, who was interested in finding arguments capable of explaining the necessary links between facts, posited a number of epistemological disti nctions between necessary signs and weak signs. The Stoics,
who were only interested in the formal mechanisms of inference,
avoided the problem. Only Quintilian (lnstitutio aratoria 5. 9), who was 
Signs [37]
interested in the reactions of a forensic audience, tried to account for
every type of persuasive sign according to an epistemological hierarchy.
Quintilian does not disagree with Aristotle's classification in the
Rhetoric, but he warns that necessary signs can deal with the past (if she
has given birth she must have been with a man), with the present (if
there is a strong wind on the sea, there must necessarily be waves) and
with the future (if one has been stabbed in the heart, one will necessarily die).
Clearly, though, these presumed temporal links are in truth different
combinations of cause-effect links. The link between giving birth and
sexual intercou rse (diagnostic sign) goes back from the effect to the
cause, while the link between wound and death (prognostic sign) goes
from the cause to its possible effects. However, this distinction is not
homologous to the distinction between necessary signs and weak signs.
Every cause does not necessarily refer us forward to all its possible effects (weak prognostic sign), and not all effects necessarily refer us back
to the same cause (weak diagnostic sign). Who carries the torch, the
enemy or the allies? A distinction should also be made between necessary
causes and sufficient causes. Oxygen is a necessary cause for combustion (so
that if there is combustion, then there is oxygen), but the striking of a
match is only a sufficient cause for combustion (in occurrence with other
possible causes). One could then say that Aristotle's weak sign goes from
effect to sufficient cause (if one has a hard time breath ing, then one has
a fever); but, when better examined, the weak sign also exhibits a degree of 'necessity' - except that this sign refers to a class of causes,
rather than to one cause; if there is a torch, then someone must have lit it
and must be carrying it. If there is difficulty in breathing, then necessarily there is an alteration of the cardiac rhythm (a class of events which
includes also fever). These types of signs should have a necessary conseq uent, but the consequent is still too wide and it must be narrowed
(passage from the class to a member of the class) on the basis of other
contextual inferences (as Hippocrates knew quite well).
In verbal language a similar process takes place , since I can name an
entity by synecdoche from genus to species. Instead of saying 'human
beings' , I can say 'mortals' .
The prognostic sign from cause to effect involves a number of problems as well. Thomas Aquinas says (Summa Theologiae 1. 70. 2 - 2; 3.62)
that the instrumental cause can be a sign of its possible effec�: if the
hammer, then the operations that it can be expected to perform . This is
how the police operate. If weapons are found in an apartment, their
possible criminal usage is deduced. This type of sign is obviously open
to contextual inferences. The nature of the clue changes, depending
upon whether the weapons are found in the house of a presumed ter-
[38] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
rorist, of a police officer, or of a gunsmith. And why does Aquinas not
mention, for instance, the efficient cause? Cannot the presence of a
well-known murderer in town be a sign of criminal intent on his or her
part? As for the final cause, is it not the basis for the cui prodest type of
argumentation?
It appears, then, that all prognostic signs are weak because of the
epistemological nature of inference ( the link is not a necessary one),
whereas all diagnostic signs can be weak because of the generality of the
implicatum (the class of the consequents is too wide). Today epistemology, inductive logic, and probability theory know how to measure the
various degrees of episte mological force. One might ask why Aristotle
and, above all, Quintilian did not hesitate to list as possible evidence
every type of sign, even though they were aware of their different epistemological force. But, at the rhetorical level, links are mostly based on
conventions and common opinions. Quintilian cites as verisimilar the following argument: if Atalanta goes walking in the woods with boys, then
she is probably not a virgin any more. In certain communities this verisimilitude · can be as convincing as a necessary sign. It depends on the
codes and on the scripts (cf. Eco 1 979) which the community registers as
'good' .
The hiatus between 'scientific' certitude and 'social' certitude constitutes the difference between scientific hypotheses and laws, on the one
hand , and semiotic codes, on the other. The necessity of scientific evidence has little in common with the necessity of semiotic evidence. Scientifically, the whale is a mammal, but in many people's competence it
is a fish. Scientifically, a lemon is necessarily a citrus fruit, and it is not
necessarily yellow. But for a reader of poetry (Montale: "The golden
trumpets of solarity"), the lemon is a yellow fruit, and its being a citrus
is irrelevant.
Therefore, at the semiotic level, the conditions of necessity of a sign are
socially determined, either according to weak codes or according to strong
codes. In this way, an event can be a sure sign, even though scientifically it is not so. This hierarchy of semiotic necessity supports the
correlational links between antecedents and consequents, and renders
them as strong as the correlations between expression and content.
A typology of the various coding levels can be found in E co (1976, ch.
3), with a theory o( the modes of sign production. This review of the
possibilities of sign production shows that there is a semiosic continuum
which goes from the strongest kind of coding to the most open and indeterminate. The task of a general semiotics is that of tracing a single formal
structure which underlies all these phenomena, this structure being that
of the inference which generates interpretation.
The task of specific semiotics, on the other hand, will be that of

[39]
system in question - the rules of
for inferences (institutionalization
When - still in semiotic terms - the class of the consequents is very
imprecise, we have a sign which is either not yet coded, vaguely coded
(the 'symbol'), or in the process of being coded (see Eco 1 979, ch. 3 for
the process of code invention; and Chapter 4 of this book). Usually,
code invention takes the form of the most daring of inferences, that of
abduction or hypothesis.
1.11. Abduction and inferential nature of signs
Compared to ded uction and induction, abduction gives rise to three different inferential schemes ( Figure 1.3), where the solid-line boxes indicate propositions which are already verified and where the broken-line
boxes indicate tentative propositions produced in the process of reasoning.
If signs were rooted in mere equivalence, their understanding would
represent a simple case of modus ponens: every time one utters /man/ one
means « rational mortal animal>• . But one uttered /man/; therefore, one
meant « rational mortal animal». This is in fact the absolutely deductive
process we implement when dealing with substitutional tables, as it
happens with the dots and dashes of the Morse alphabet. But it does not
seem that we do the same with all the other signs, that is, when we are
not invited to recognize the conventional equivalence between two expressions belonging to two different semiotic systems, but when we have
to decide what content should be correlated to a given expression.
If we did not know the meaning of a sign and had to reconstruct it
through repeated experiences, the correct process to develop would appear to be of an inductive type. Apparently, this is how ostensive definitions work. Each time a native speaking a language unknown to us utters
the expression /x/, he or she either points to the object Y or there is a
recurrence of experience Y. Therefore , that word can reasonably be interpreted as meaning that class of objects or of actions. The induction by
ostensive interpretation is shown to be very precarious by Augustine in
De Magistro. When Augustine asks Adeodatus how he would explain the
meaning of the verb /to walk/, Adeodatus answers that he would start
walking. And when Augustine asks him what he would do if the question were posed to him while walking, Adeodatus answers that he would
start walking faster. Augustine then replies that the answer could be
understood to mean that the sense of /to walk/ is «to hurry up» . Obviously, the accumulation of ostensive signs does not clarify the meaning
of a term by simple induction. A frame of reference is necessary, a

metalinguistic (or, rather, metasemiotic) rule expressed in some way,
prescribing what rule should be used in order to understand ostension.
But at this point we have already arrived at the mechanism of abduction.
Only if I hypothesize that Adeodatus' behavior (in which his h urry acts
as a metasemiotic mechanism which should make evident the act of
walking) constitutes the interpretation of the linguistic term am I able to
suppose that what he calls to my attention ( Result) is a case of the
hypothesized Rule. This procedure occurs in the decoding of known
linguistic terms as well, when one is uncertain about what language they
belong to. When someone tells me /cane!/ in an excited voice, in order
to understand whether it is a Latin imperative ( «sing! ») or an Italian
holophrastic indexical proposition ( « dog! »), I must hypothesize a language as a frame of reference. The fact that there are circumstantial and
contextual clues to direct me toward the determination of the rule does
not change in principle the structure of the interpretive process.
Abduction is, therefore,
·
the tentative andhazardous tracing of a system of signification rules which will allow the sign to acquire its meanmg.
Abduction occurs with those natural signs which the Stoics called indicative and which are thought to be signs, yet without knowing what they
signify. Kepler noticed that the orbit of Mars passes th rough points x and
y (this example is given by Peirce, C. P. 2.96): this was the Result, but
the Rule of which this was a Case was not yet known (the consequents
of this antecedent being, therefore, equally unknown). Points x and y
could have been points of, among other possible geometrical figures, an
ellipse. Kepler hypothesized the Rule (and this was an act of imaginative
courage): they are the points of an ellipse. Therefore, if the orbit of
Mars were in point of fact elliptical, then its passing through x and y
( Result) would have been a case of that Rule. The abduction, of course,
had to be verified . In the light of the hypothesized rule, x and y were
'signs' of the further passage of Mars through the points z and k. It was
obviously necessary to wait for Mars at the spot where the first 'sign' had 
Signs [41]
led one to expect its appearance. Once the hypothesis was verified , the
abduction had to be widened (and verified): the behavior of Mars was
hypothetically thought to be shared by all the other planets. The behavior of a planet thus became a sign for the general behavior of planets.
Abduction is a very complex mode of inference, and there are probably many types of abduction, ranking from the simplest and easiest to
the more complex and tentative. Thagard (1978) has distinguished between hypothesis and abduction in connection with the distinction between overcoding and undercoding (Eco 1 976, 2. 14); Bonfantini and
Proni (1983) have outlined three types of abduction, and I have elaborated on this proposal (Eco 1 983). The three types of abduction I shall
outline here represent a typological abstraction, a sort of rough segmentation of a more finely segmentable continuum. In other words, one
could find concrete examples of abduction which cover intermediate
positions between the first and the second or between the second and
the third types, as well as complex processes that combine these different types.
(a) There is a hypothesis or an overcoded obduction when the law is given
automatically or quasi-automatically. This 'quasi' is to be taken very
seriously. Let us suppose that a verbal language represents a system of
a bsolute equ ivalences and that in this language /man/ stands for
« rational mortal animal> •. When someone utters /man/, I must first assume that this utterance is the token of a type of Engl ish word. It seems
that usually we do this kind of interpretive labor automatically, but it is
enough that we are living in an international milieu in which people are
supposed to speak different languages, and we realize that our choice is
not completely an automatic one. To recognize a given phenomenon as
the token of a given type presupposes some hypothesis about the circumstances of utterance, the nature of the speaker, and the discursive
co-text. Thagard suggests that this kind of hypothesis corresponds to my
notion of overcoding and says that, since the rule is already given, the
inference concerns only the decision to recognize the Result as the Case
of that Rule. I agree, but I insist on the fact that, since one has to decide
to connect that Rule with that Result through the mediation of the Case,
then the process is never fully automatic.
Abductions of this type are also implemented in co-textual interpretation. The example provided by Augustine apropos of ex (see 1 . 9) represents an interesting instance of s uch an inferential process. Augustine
knew that /ex/ meant the separation of something from something else;
he still had to decide how to identify the two terms of this relationship
within the co-text he was interpreting. His decision was quasi-automatic;
however, he had to figure out a hypothesis - even though a hardly challengeable one. 
[42] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
(b) There IS an undercoded abduction when the rule must be selected
among a series of equiprobable alte.rnatives. In Chapter 2 of this book it
is maintained that our semantic representations do not follow the model
of a dictionary but of an encyclopedia. Therefore, we have no guarantees
that the meaning of /man/ is necessarily, and in every context, «rational
mortal animal,, . According to different contextual and circumstantial
selections (see Eco 1 976, 2. I I), a man also can be a very virile person, a
brave male, a two-footed creature, and so on. Therefore, when one utters /this is a man/, we have to decide whether one says that this is a
rational animal, a mortal creature, or a good example of virility, and so
on. Likewise, /this is not a man/ can mean either <<this is not rational» or
<<this is not mortal», depending on whether the sentence is about a
monster p roduced by Doctor Frankenstein or about an angel. The decision as to whether certain properties ( belonging to the meaning of a
term) must be blown up or narcotized (see Eco 1 979 and Chapter 2 of
this book) represents a good case of u ndercoded abduction. Thagard
calls this kind of reasoning an abduction stricto sensu: the rule selected
can be, in a given co-text, the most plausible one, but it is not certain
whether it is the most correct or the only correct one . Thus the explanation is entertained, waiting for further tests.
A case of undercoded abduction, working for nonl inguistic signs, is
the one of Kepler's discovery, quoted above. Kepler met a surprising
fact, and then he had to select among alternative explanations: there
were many geometrical curves that could account for the movement of
Mars. Their number was not infinite, and some p revious assumptions
about the regularity of the universe suggested to Kepler that he had to
look only for closed, nontranscendental curves; therefore , ellipsis
seemed more plausible than spyrals or sinewaves. Notwithstanding this
hierarchy of plausibilities, Kepler had to try.
(c) There are, finally, cases of creative abduction, in which the rule acting
as an explanation has to be invented ex novo. This could be the case of
Copernicus when he had the intuition of heliocentrism in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. Copernicus felt that the Ptolemaic system was
inelegant, without harmony, like a painting in which the painter reproduced all the members without composing them into a unique body.
Then he decided that the sun ought to be at the center of the universe
because only in this way the created world would have displayed an
admirable symmetry. He figured out a possible world whose guarantee
was its being well structured, 'gestaltically' elegant. As in every case of
creative abduction, this way of reasoning required a sort of metaabduction, which consisted in deciding whether the possible universe (or
state of things) outlined by the creative abduction was the same as the
'real' universe. In over- and undercoded abduction this metalevel of in-
Signs [43]
ference is not compulsory, because there are preexisting explanations of
the same kind that have already proved to be plausible in other cases. In
other words, in over- and undercoded abductions one uses explanations
that already held for different results. In creative abductions one is not
sure that the explanation one has selected is a 'reasonable' one.
We i mplement creative abduction when dealing with poetic texts, as
well as when solving criminal cases. Many interpretive decisions concerning symbols (see Chapter 4 of this book) involve creative abductions. Many cases in which language is used not to confirm but to challenge a given world view or a scientific paradigm, and to decide that
certain properties cannot belong any longer to the meaning of a given
term (see Chapter 2 of this book) require an interpretive cooperation that
displays many characteristics of a creative abduction.
So far, inferences are at work at every level of semiosis, in verbal
language as well as in the understanding of so-called natural signs. In
this sense, there is a link between theory of meaning and theory of evidence that, according to Harman (see I .4 above), is to be carefully distinguished . If there is a difference, it is not between linguistic and natural signs or between words and symptoms, but rather between semiotic
and scientific inference, or between two kinds of certitude.
The semiotic plausibility is based on social habits , whereas the scientific plausibility is based on other criteria of verifiability. This difference
is of the greatest relevance under many respects, indeed. But it should
not blur that other evidence: that we deal both with language and with
every other kind of sign by implementing inferential processes. These
processes can be defined as interpretive processes. The understanding of
signs is not a mere matter of recognition (of a stable equivalence); it is a
matter of interpretation.
1.12. The criterion of interpretability
Thus s!lbstitution (a liquid stat pro aliquo ) is not the only necessary condition for a sign: the possibility of interpretation is necessary as well. By
interpretation (or criterion of interpretability) we mean the concept
elaborated by Peirce, according to which every interpretant (either a sign
or an expression or a sequence of expressions which translate a previous
expression), besides translating the Immediate Object or the content of
the sign, also increases our understanding of it. The criterion of interpretability allows us to start from a sign in order to cover, step by step,
the entire circle of semiosis. Peirce maintained that a term is a rud imentary proposition and that a proposition is a rudimentary argumentation
(C. P. 2.342 - 44). By sayi ng father I have already produced a twoargument predicate: if father, then someone who is a child of this father. 
[44] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
The interpreted content allows me to go beyond the original sign and
makes me see the need for future contextual occurrence of another sign.
From the proposition 'every father has or has had a child', one can go on
to analyze whole argumentative topics, while the intensional mechanism
leads us in the direction of propositions to be analyzed extensionally.
At this point it is clear that the death sentence pronounced on the sign
on the basis of the charges of equality, similitude, and reduction of
differences was quite unfounded. It based itself on the blackmail of a
'flat' linguistic sign, seen as a type of correlation based on dead-end
equivalence, on the substitution of the same. In truth, the sign always
opens up something new. No interpretant, in adjusting the sign interpreted, fails to change its borders to some degree.
To interpret a sign means to define the portion of continuum which
serves as its vehicle in its relationship with the other portions of the
continuum derived from its global segmentation by the content. It
means to define a portion through the use of other portions, conveyed by
other expressions. If the interpretation is pushed to its extreme, it is
possible to cast doubt on the content determined at the beginning, and
even the global criterion of segmentation. This implies that we must cast
doubt on the way in which the form of the content has segmented the
continuum.
Hjelmslev leads us to believe in the existence of two separate continua, one for the expression and one for the content. But the signfunction model should, in the light of Peirce's semiotics, be reformulated ( Figure 1 .4). The matter, the continuum about which and through
which signs speak, is always the same. It is the Dynamic Object that
Peirce talked about that motivates the sign, though the sign does not
render it immediately, since its expression only conveys an Immediate
Object (the content). A specific civilization organizes the content in the
shape of fields, axes, subsystems, and partial systems which are often
not coherent with each other. They are articulated according to a specific
contextual perspective (and the context can be the culture of a millennium as well as a poem or a diagram). These content-segments can correspond to physical entities (woman, dog, house), abstract concepts
(good, evil), actions (to run, to eat), genera and species (animal, plane
figure), as well as directions and relations (above, before , toward , if and
then, or). These portions are articulated in larger sequences according to
the inferential links we described above. In order to express them, one
must choose formalized or formalizable portions of the continuum, which
ore the some as what is talked about, that is, the same continuum segmented by the content. Sometimes the material elements, chosen in
order to express them, utilize portions of the continuum different from
the expressed continuum (sounds c
·
an be used in order to express spatial 
Signs [45]
relations). At other times the same portion of the continuum is used as
material both for the expression and for the content (spatial relationships
in a diagram used to express spatial relationships on a tridimensional
surface).
FIGURE 1 .4
The matter segmented in order to express something expresses other
segmentations of that matter. Through this interplay from sign to sign,
the world {the continuum, the pulp itself of the matter which is manipulated by semiosis) is called into question. The form that we attribute to
the Dynamic Object is continuously changed through the formulation of
I mmediate Objects and their constant redefinition by successive interpretants .
1.13. Sign and subject
The notion of sign as expression of equality and identity could be
legitimately claimed to support a sclerotic (and ideological) notion of the
subject. The sign as the locus (constantly interrogated) for the semiosic
process constitutes, on the other hand, the instrument through which
the subject is continuously made and unmade. The subject enters a
beneficial crisis because it shares in the historical (and constitutive) crisis
of the sign. The subject is constantly reshaped by the endless resegmentation of the content. In this way (even though the process of resegmentation must be activated by someone, who is probably the collectivity of
subjects), the subject is spoken by language (verbal and nonverbal), by
the dynamic of sign-functions rather than by the chain of signifiers. As
subjects, we are what the shape of the world produced by signs makes us
become.
Perhaps we are, somewhere, the deep impulse which generates
semiosis. And yet we recognize ourselves only as semiosis in progress,
signifying syste ms and communicational p rocesses. The map of
semiosis, as defined at a given stage of historical development (with the
debris carried over from previous semiosis), tells us who we are and what
(or how) we think.

DICTIONARY VS.
ENCYCLOPEDIA
2.1. Porphyry strikes back
2.1.1. Is a definition an interpretation?
The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the untenabili ty of that model
for definition, structured by genera, species, and differentiae, known as
the Porphyrian tree and elaborated from Boethius through the whole
Middle Ages, as an interpretation of the lsagoge written by the Phoenician Porphyry in the third century A. D. It would seem preposterous to
criticize such a venerable and outdated theory. But every revisitation of
the history of signs is fruitful , because it helps to discover the remote
origins of some contemporary theoretical 'cramps' . Porphyry is still alive
in many semantic theories.
A sign is not only something which stands for something else; it is also
something that can and must be interpre ted . The cri terion of interpretability allows us to start from a given sign to cover, step by step, the
whole universe of semiosis.
This criterion (as we have s hown in the first chapter of this book) held
for the classical notion of natural signs, based on an inferential model (p
:> q), but it s hould hold also for linguistic signs, even though they were
based, by a long historical tradition, on the model of equivalence (p =
q). This latter idea of sign as identity was due to the persuasion that the
meaning or the content of a given linguistic expression was either a synonymous expression or its definition. Irrespective of whether the definition is provided by genus and differentia (/man/ = « rational mortal
animal») or by a series of semantic components or markers (/man/ =
« human + male + adult»), there should be a biconditional link between
definiens and definiendum. One can say that not even this model excludes
[46] 
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [47]
an interpretive process: undoubtedly « rational mortal animal» says something more than the verbal utterance /man/, especially if 'mortal' , 'rational' , and 'animal' are interpreted in their turn. However, every decision about this matter concerns the choice between a dictionary and an
encyclopedia, a crucial question widely discussed in the course of the last
decades (see, for instance , Wilson 1 967; Katz 1 972 ; Putnam 1 975;
Rey-Debove 1 971; and, for the most complete and convincing overview
of the problem, Haiman 1 980). Naturally, one must distinguish between
the opposition dictionary/encyclopedia as it is intended in the publishing
world and the same opposition as conceived in semiotic or philosophical
terms. It suffices to read some of the analyses of the current dictionaries
and encyclopedias (see, for instance, Weinreich 1 980; Rey-Debove 1 971)
to realize that, if so-called encyclopedias are in some way encyclopedic,
so-called dictionaries are rather impoverished encyclopedias.
If one consults the 1 974 edition of the Merriam-Webster dictionary,
one finds that /bull/ is defined as an << adult male bovine animal, (a
definition that would titillate every fan of a semiotic dictionary); but
/tiger/ is defined as « a large tawny black striped Asiatic flesh-eating
mammal related to cat», and this definition is as if it were conceived to
support Putnam's idea of 'stereotypes' .
:z.I.:z. The idea of a dictionary
The first semiotician to outline the idea of a dictionary was probably
Hjelmslev. After having analyzed expressions into minor elements or
figurae so that "unrestricted inventories are resolved into restricted"
(1943:71), he tried to do the same for the content-plane. If the analysis
of the expression-plane consists "in the resolution of entities that enter
unrestricted inventories (e.g. , word-expressions) into entities that enter
restricted inventories, and this resolution is carried on until only the
most restricted inventories remain" (ibid.), the same procedure must be
followed for the content plane:
While the inventory of word-contents is unrestricted, in a language of familiar structures even the minimal signs will be distributed (on the basis of
relational differences) into some (selected) inventories, which are unrestricted (e. g. , inventories of root-contents), and other (selecting) inventories,
which are restricted (e. g. , i nventories embracing contents of derivational and
inflexional elements, i.e. , derivatives and morphemes). Thus in practice the
procedure consists in trying to analyze the entities that enter the unrestricted inventories purely into entities that enter the restricted inventories.
(Ibid.)
The example given by Hjelmslev concerns a series of word-contents
corresponding to the common nouns ram, ewe, man, woman, boy, girl, 
[48] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
stallion, more, sheep, human being, child, and horse and to the pronouns he
and she. Hjelmslev reduces the inventory in a way that can be represented by the diagram in Figure 2. I. He thought that the word-contents
of the expressions horse, sheep, human being, and child belonged to unrestricted inventories, while she and he belonged to a category "with a restricted number of members."

HE
SHEEP HUMAN CHILD HORSE

FIGURE 2 . 1
Hjelmslev's proposal seems to account for some linguistic phenomena
that, according to the further semantic literature, should be explained by
a dictionary. If a dictionary concerns purely our linguistic knowledge
without giving instructions as to how to use linguistic terms in order to
mention things or states of the world, Hjelmslev's dictionary undoubtedly explains why such sentences as o ewe is o female sheep and if x is o ewe
then x is not o stallion are semantically well formed, even though the user
of that language never had a direct acquaintance with a sheep or with a
stallion. In fact, other dictionary theories, in order to provide instructions
for reference, provide another kind of information; see, for instance, the
idea of 'distinguishers' in Katz and Fodor (1963) and the reformulation of
this principle in Katz's 'neoclassical theory of reference' (1979).
Hjelmslev's dictionary seems to explain (as usually requested to a dictionary) at least the following phenomena: (a) synonymy and paraphrase
(a ewe is a female sheep); (b) similarity and difference (rom/stallion,
ewe/more, and stallion/more have a common semantic component, but in
a different respect a stallion is different from a mare, and a mare is
different from a ewe); (c) antonymy (girl/boy); (d) hyperonymy and
hyponymy (horse/stallion); (e) meani ngfu lness and semantic anomaly
(stallions ore mole makes sense, whereas o female stallion is anomalous); (f)
semantic ambiguity (a more complete dictionary should explain the possible ambiguity between rom as male sheep and rom as a warship); (g)
redundancy (unfortunately in such a limited dictionary redu ndancy
coincides with meaningfulness; o mole rom is both meaningful and redundant); (h) analytic truth (for the same reason as above roms ore mole is
at the same time meaningful, redu ndant, and analytically true, since the
meaning of the subject contains the meaning of the predicate); (i) contradictoriness (roms ore female); (j) syntheticity (the dictionary recognizes
expressions such as sheep provide wool as depending on one's world
knowledge); (k) inconsistency (this is o rom and this is a ewe cannot be 
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [49]
true at the same time if referred to the same individual); (I) containment
and semantic entailment: these two phenomena are strictly dependent
on each other since, by virtue of the dictionary, every term is supposed
to 'contain' certain properties; on the basis of these semantic rules (and
independently of any other logical law) the sentence this is a ram entails
this is a sheep, the sentence this is not a sheep entails this is not a ram, and
the sentence this is not a ram leaves unprejudiced whether this is a sheep
or not.
I have severely limited my list of requirements for a dictionary (other
au thors introduce more controversial req uirements; see, for instance,
Katz 1 972, 5 - 6). In any case, Hjelmslev's proposal for a dictionary
leaves unsolved two important q uestions: how to define the meaning of
the components or figurae (in other words, if ram means male sheep,
what does sheep mean?) and how to obtain a finite or unrestricted inventory.
Let us first consider the second problem. The most rigorous supporters of a theoretical dictionary maintain that the meaning of linguistic
expressions should be represented through a finite number of semantic
primitives (components, markers, properties, universal concepts).
It is not strictly necessary to assume that the set of definienda be a
finite one. Naturally, the ideal condition for a dictionary is that this dictionary, being "the reconstruction of an aspect of the speaker's semantic
competence," storing "only finitely many bits of information about a
particular lexical item," be "a finite list of entries" so that "each entry
consists of a finite number of lexical readings, and that each lexical reading contains a finite number of semantic markers" (Katz 1 972:59- 6o).
However, it is theoretically possible to conceive of a consistent number
of primitives whose combination permits the description of an open
"number of definienda.
At this point the problems are (a) how to determine the primitives and
(b) how to guarantee that their number be a finite one. As far as the
determination of the primitives is concerned, the discussion is still open.
Haiman (1980) remarks that (according to the current philosophical and
semiotic literature) these primitives can be identified only in three ways:
(a) Primitives are 'simple' (or the 'simplest' ) concepts . It is, however,
very hard to decide what a 'simple' concept is. In terms of the speaker's
intuition, 'human' is simpler than 'mammal' (since every speaker is able
to tell whether something or somebody is a human being or not, whereas
we have problems in telling whether a dolphin is more a ' mammal' than
a platypus). It must be clear that in this case 'simpler' or 'simplest' does
not mean more general; therefore, 'simplest' concepts risk being more
numerous than the 'complicated' ones. It is true that it is not necessary 
[SO] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
that the primitives be less than the definienda: "a phonological features
analysis ,would not be invalidated by the discovery that there are more
features than phonemes in some language" (Dean Fodor 1 977: 1 47).
However, this remark can hold in phonemics, since a language has a
finite number of phonemes. But if a language has a potentially open
number of expressions to be defined , can one accept that this open
series be defined by a series of primitives that is indefinitely open as
well? Moreover, the quest for 'simple' concepts leads one· to the second
way, and the strictures holding for the latter also hold for the former.
(b) The primitives are rooted in our world experience, that is, they are
'object words' (in the sense of Russell 1 940). The meaning of an object
word is given by direct ostension of a state of the world, that is, of things
that we meet in the course of our experience. A child learns by ostension
what red means. On the contrary, there are 'dictionary words' that must
be defined in terms of other dictionary words. It is, however, difficult to
ascertain whether a word is an 'object' or a 'dictionary' one; as Russell
remarks, pentagram is to most people a dictionary word , but to a child
brought up in a house decorated with pentagrams it might be an object
word (1940: 70). Wierzbicka (1972:21) lists among object words sea, river,
field, wood, cloud, mountain, wind, table, house, book, paper, bird, fish, insect, plant, animal, cat, apple, rose, birch, gold, salt, and so on - a very
'open' series, indeed, which reminds one of the open list of 'natural
kinds' conj ured up by the theories of 'rigid designation' (Kripke 1 972;
Putnam 1 975). But, once one has decided to go on in this direction, the
list of primitives cannot be a finite one. Moreover, the idea of a list of
semantic primitives is devised in order to conceive of a dictionary-like
competence free of any commitment to world knowledge , but, if one
takes the option (b), then the dictionary competence is entirely dependent on the world knowledge.
(c) The primitives are Platonic ideas. This position is philosophically
impeccable, but there is a historical (and therefore empirical) inconvenience: not even Plato succeeded in limiting in a satisfactory way the system of these universal and innate ideas. E ither there is an idea for every
'natural kind' , and the dictionary is not finite, or there are few very
general ideas (One, Good, Multiplicity, and so on), and they do not
succeed in distinguishing the meaning of any single expression.
One can, however, conceive of a fourth and more theoretical way.
Suppose there is the possibility of establishing a system of primitives
such that, by virtue of their systematic relationship, they must be finite
in number. If one's mind succeeds in doing this, this can be taken as
proof that s uch a systematic arrangement in some way 'mirrors' the structure of the human mind (and probably also the structure of the world). 
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [5 1]
Fortunately, we have a good example of such a system: it is represented by a purely lexical system of hyponyms and hyperonyms organized in the format of a tree such that every n-tuple of hyponyms postulates a single hyperonym, and every n-tuple of hyperonyms becomes an
n-tuple of hyponyms of a higher single hyperonym, and so on, until the
point where, irrespective of the number of hyponyms to be classified at
the lower row of the tree, the tree necessarily tapers at a single uppermost node. Figure 2.2 represents a tree of this kind by simply reorganizing the terms provided by Hjelmslev. One can say that ewe contains or
comprises 'sheep' and (by a transitive property of this classification) contains or comprises 'animal' . One can also say that this tree represents a
system of meaning postulates in the sense of Carnap (1974). In fact, if the
form of a meaning postulate is
(x) (Sx :::> Ax),
the fact that x is a sheep postulates the fact that x is on animal and this is a
sheep entails this is on animal.
animal
�
sheep human
/\ �
ewe ram girl boy
FIGURE 2.2
A s e t o f meaning postulates is, however, different from the system of
Figu re 2.2. Carnap's formula holds even though S stands for raven and A
stands for block. According to this meaning postulate, if this is a raven, this
is block is an instance of analytic truth, and, if there was not a meaning
postulate establishing that sheep are animals, this sheep is on animal
would be an example of synthetic or factual truth . A set of meaning
postulates is established on 'pragmatic' grounds (cf. Lyons 1977: 204) and
does not distinguish between encyclopedia and dictionary (see Carnap
1 947).
The system of Figure 2. 2 represents, on the contrary, an ordered set of
meaning postulates, because it is hierarchically structured; for this reason it
must be finite. One can think that it can be so because the way in which
a lexicon of a natural langu age establishes relationships of hypo/
hyperonomy reproduces some (as yet mysterious) structure of the human
mind. Fortu nately, one can disregard such a tremendous question. In
any case, the system of Figure 2. 2 (even were it 'true' or 'natural' or
'universal') is not an instance of a 'powerful' dictionary. Its inconveniences are the following: (a) it does not say what sheep or animal means
(once again it does not explain the meaning of figurae); (b) it does not 
[52] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
help one to distinguish a ram from a ewe, since both are sheep and
animals; (c) it does account for such phenomena as hyperonomy,
hyponymy, meaningfulness and anomaly, redundancy, analytic truth,
contradictoriness, inconsistency, containment, and entailment, but it
does not account for such phenomena as synonymy, paraphrase, and
semantic difference.
To conclude, the tree of Figure 2.2 cannot provide the means for giving definitions. As Aristotle knew very well, there is a good definition
when, in order to identify the essence of something, one selects attributes such that, although each of them has wider extension than the
subject, all together they have not (Post. An. 2.96a. 35). There must be
fu ll reciprocability between definiendum and definiens.
Supposing that /ram/ can be defined as the only « horned male
sheep», then not only does this is a ram entail this is a horned male sheep
but also this is a horned male sheep entails this is a ram as well as this is not a
ram entails this is not a horned male sheep, and vice versa. Definiens and
deftniendum can be substituted for each other in every context.
This cannot happen with the tree of Figure 2.2. Not only does this is
an animal sheep not entail this is o ram, bu t also x is my preferite rom does
not entail this is my preferite animo/, all roms ore horned does not entail all
animals are horned, and, if one deletes the hyponym, one does not necessarily delete the hyperonym.
Thus we must now think of a different system that, while displaying
the same 'good' characteristics of the tree of Figure 2.2, is also able to
account for the phenomena that the latter leaves unsolved. Let us try,
then, a second tree (Figure 2. 3), which in some way reproduces the
procedure used by natu ralists in order to classify animal species.
It is certainly imprudent to equate l i nguistic inventories with
taxonomies in natural sciences: Dupre (1981) has demonstrated not only
that, where a layman identifies a specie� (for example, beetle), the
entomologist identifies something like 290,000 species, but also that the
lexical system of a natural language and scientific taxonomies overlap in
a very 'fuzzy' way. We call tree both an elm and a pine tree, while a
naturalist would say that the former is an 'angiosperm' and that the latter
is not. There is no taxonomic equivalent of tree and no ordinary language
equivalent of angiosperm.
However, Hjelmslev's proposal can allow one to conceive of a sort of
taxonomic tree as in Figure 2.3, designed to define without ambiguity
and with the maximum economy a series of words, namely, dog, wolf,
fox, cat, tiger, lynx, bachelor (as a seal), horse, ox, buffalo, sheep, mouflon,
elephant and echidna. In such a linguistic (and natural) universe, one is not
supposed to distinguish a horse from an ass or an elephant from a
rhinoceros, and this explains why only certain lower disjunctions are 
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [53]
called for. In this sense, the tree of Figure 2.3 overlaps only partially a
cu rrent scientific taxonomy.
The tree of Figure 2.3 provides the picture of a very restricted universe made up of natural kinds (of which the words in italic in the lower
row provide names). We are obliged to consider this universe as a restricted one for the sake of our experiment: this u niverse is scarcely
similar to the one of our actual experience , but when speaking of dictionaries one must conceive not only of very artificial languages but also
of very artificial worlds. For instance, this universe takes into account
neither 'artificial' kinds (such as a house or a chair) nor predicates, nor
actions, nor social roles (such as 'king' , 'bachelor' , 'pilot'). It has been
remarked how it is difficult to account for all these problems at the same
time (see Schwartz 1 977:37- 4 1 ). Aristotle (and Porphyry) dealt with
natural kinds in the tree of substances, admitting that all the other
phenomena should have been dealt with in one of the possible trees for
the other nine categories (see 2.2. I). As for artificial kinds, Aristotle was
convinced that one can deal with them as if they were substances, but
according to some a nalogical p rocedures (see Metaphysics, 1 043b21,
1 070a - b).
It is not necessary to decide whether the li nguistic terms in each node
of the tree names classes included within larger classes or properties in
some way contained or postulated by the terms naming the natural kinds
listed in italic in the lowest row. One can say that any name of a subclass
postulates its class or that every name of natural kinds postulates a
hierarchical series of properties. In lexicographical representations of a
system of hypo/hyperonyms, it is usual to assume that, if the meaning of
a word is incl uded within the meaning of another, then "each 'included'
meaning has all the features of the 'including' meaning ... plus at least
one more feature which serves to distinguish the more restricted area"
(Nida 1 975 : 1 6).
In any case, the whole system of Figu re 2.3 is a finite one, which
accounts also for synonymy, paraphrase, and semantic difference and which
permits the production of definitions . Only a cat is a « felis catus, felis,
fetid, fissiped, carnivorous placental animal», and, if something does not
have all these properties in conjunction, then it cannot be a cat.
This tree accounts for all the phenomena that a good dictionary is
supposed to explain. It is a very flexible tool . Suppose one has to explain
also the meaning of /halibut/; it will be sufficient to insert the disju nction 'fish/mammal' under the node 'animal' , and the tree would equally
taper toward an ultimate node. With further complications one could also
distinguish /bachelor/ as a seal from /bachelor/ as a human being. The
tree would always result in being finite.
The tree does not offer the possibility of distinguishing between male 
[54] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILGISOPHY OF LANGUAGE
and female, adult and young. It is a pity; we shall see apropos of the
Porphyrian Tree (in 2. 1 . 3) how embarrassing these kinds of 'accidents'
are. But before coming to grips with these formidable questions, we
have to raise a more urgent criticism .
2.1.3. The interpretation of the markers
The tree explains without ambiguity that a cat is nothing else but a 'felis
catus' . But in Latin (even though at two different historical stages of this
language) both /felis/ and lcatus/ (or cattus) are synonymous with the
E nglish word /cat/. Thus the definiens and the definiendum are certainly
interchangeable, but only because they are absolu tely and redundantly
synonymous: a cat is a cat is a cat is a cat. If one asks what afelis catus is,
one knows that it is a felis, which is not enough to distinguish a cat from
a tiger.
However, when a zoologist says that what we call cat is a 'Felis catus'
he is not merely playing on words. He uses Felis as the name of a genus
and catus as the name of a differentia, but by these short-hand expressions he intends to signify other biological properties. To be a catus
means to have the properties ph p2 ••• Pn. and to be a Felis means to
have the properties ph p2, ••• p,. (and so on for the upper nodes).
The taxonomy of the zoologist does not intend to be a way to analyze
the meaning of the word /cat/; it represents a mere classification of natural kinds, accidentally labeled with certain names (changing from natural
language to natural language). The zoologist as such is strongly interested in defining the actual p roperties of the species he classifies, yet
these properties are simply contained or meant by the terms he uses as
taxonomic labels.
If a zoologist is told that gorillas grow in Ireland, he can react in two
ways. Either he understands the sentence in the sense that some gorillas
are born in Ireland, and in this case he is eager to concede that similar
events happen in zoological gardens, or he takes the sentence as conveying an 'eternal' proposition (all the animals belonging to this species
grow in Irel and), and then he would say that the proposition is
analytically false because it challenges some information that belongs to
his definition of gorillas. Likewise he would not discuss the statement
this sheep has three feet, since he knows that there can be handicapped
sheep, but he would challenge the state ment sheep are not four-footed because in his defi nition of a sheep there is a marker (probably 'ungulata' )
that must be interpreted in terms of four-footedness. Perhaps the zoologist
would not say that sheep are four-footed necessarily or analytically, but he
would say that the property of being four-footed belongs to sheep in
some �trong sense of /belonging/.
Zoologists know that their classificatory markers are interpretable and

[56] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
that they are not metalinguistic constructs but words of their specific
object-language. Zoologically speaking, 'mammal' is not only a metalinguistic construct that guarantees the semantic anomaly of such assertions
as a stone is a mammal: /mammal/ means more or less << an animal which
nourishes its young with milk secreted by mammary glands». Speakers
of natural language do the same, obviously: when they say that a land is
rich in minerals, they do not intend only that that land is rich in nonliving natural objects, but intend many other interesting properties as well.
In natural language we frequently use expressions as animal, object, and
vegetal as many times as we speak of cats and wolves, and maybe more
often. This means either that we are using many terms of a metalanguage as items of a natural language or that there is a difference between
'animal' as a semantic marker and /animal/ as a linguistic expression.
But this is indeed a mere wordplay; in fact, when lexicographers or philosophers of language use the semantic marker 'animal' they are using a
word of their natural language to build up a metalanguage . One can say
that, as soon as a natural expression has become a metalinguistic term, it
should not be further interpreted; such a rigorous decision is indeed
possible and the tree of Figure 2. I proves it, but, once this decision has
been made, it is difficult to know not only what a sheep and a mouflon
are but also what /sheep/ and /mouflon/ mean .
It would be sufficient to say that a dictionary has the sole function of
providing a computer with the capability of parsing sentences in order to
test whether they are semantically consistent, red undant, or analytically
true, without explaining the meaning of their com ponent words to
someone who is not acquainted with any correspondi ng state of the
world. Yet even the most rigorous theories of a dictionary competence try
to escape this fate, and in two ways: from a practical point of view, by
matching a representation of mean ing with some instructions for the individ uation of the referents (see Katz 1 979 for the "neoclassical" theory
of meaning), and from a theoretical point of view, by defining even the
analytic markers. Katz analyzes the lexeme /chair/ as
(Object) (Physical) (Non living) (Artifact) (Furniture) (Portable) (Something with legs) (Something with a back) (Something with a seat) (Seat
for one)
so mixing up analytical properties and pieces of world knowledge; but at
the same time he says that each of the concepts represented by the
semantic markers "can itself be broken into components. For example,
the concept of an object represented by '(object)' might be analyzed as
an organization of parts that are spatio-temporally contiguous which form a
stable whole having an orientation in space" (1972 : 40).
If so, the tree of Figure 2.3 should host other markers such as 'organ-
Dictionary vs . E ncyclopedia [57]
ization' , 'part' , 'orientation' , 'space' , 'contiguous' , and so on. E ven admitting that all these markers can be inserted into a bidimensional tree
(and withou t asking what will happen when one decides to analyze,
along with 'object' , also 'living' or 'furniture' , not to mention all the
rest), we are not sure that markers such as 'contiguous' are of the same
nature as 'space' or 'animal' .
Moreover, to make the markers interpretable, usually a theory has to
give up on their hierarchy and consider them as an unordered set, that
is, it has to adopt a cross-classificatory criterion (cf. the remarks of Dean
Fodor 1 977: 1 53). We have demonstrated that, if the tree is not hierarchically organized, one has no more guarantees of dealing with a finite
number of markers.
Thus either the primitives cannot be interpreted, and one cannot explain the meaning of a term, or they can and must be interpreted , and
one cannot limit their number. The latter is the case of the Porphyrian
tree, in which the notion of diff erentia specijica is posited exactly in order
to provide a minimal, but sufficient, interpretation for every marker. Unfortunately, as we shall see , as soon as the differentiae are introduced, a
Porphyrian tree loses the properties of a dictionary and becomes an encyclopedia.
2.2. Critique of the Porphyrian tree
2.2. 1. Aristotle on definition
Aristotle says that "definition is of the essence or essential nature" (Post.
An. 2. 90b30). To define a substance means to establish, among various
accidental attributes, the esse ntial ones, particularly that one which
causes the substance to be as it is - its substantial form. The problem is
then to "hunt" for the right attributes that must be predicated as elements in the definition (96a 15). Aristotle gives the example of the attributes that can apply to the number 3: an attribute such as 'being' undoubtedly applies to 3, but also to other things that are not numbers. On
the contrary, 'oddness' applies to every 3 and , even though it has a wider
application (it also applies to 5), it nevertheless does not extend beyond
the genus 'number'. "We must select attributes of this kind, up to the
point where, although each of them has a wider extension that the subject, all together they have not; this will be the essence of the thing"
(96a35). Aristotle means that, if one defines man as a rational , mortal
animal, each of these attributes, singly, also applies to other entities (for
instance , also horses are animals, dogs are mortals, angels are rational),
but, taken as a whole, as a definitional cluster, these attributes apply
only to man (thus dejiniens and definiendum are convertible or biconditionally linked: p = q}.

However, a definition is not a demonstration: to show the essence of a
thing is not the same as to prove a proposition about it; a definition
reveals what an object is while a demonstration proves that something
can be said of a given subject (91 a1). In a definition we are assuming
what we are required to prove in a demonstration (91a35), and those who
defi ne do not prove that something exists (92b2o). A definition explains
the meaning of the name (93b30).
In his attempt to find out a right method for inferring satisfactory
definitions, Aristotle develops the theory of predicables, that is, the
modes in which the categories can be applied to a subject. In Topics
(I. IOibi7- 24) Aristotle lists only four predicables, namely, genus,
property (proprium ) , definition, and accident. Since Porphyry will definitely list five predicables (genus, species, differentia, property, and accident), this discrepancy has aroused many discussions. There was a
serious reason why Aristotle did not insert the differentia among predicables: the differentia "being generic in character, it should be ranged
with the genus" (Topics I. IOi b20), and to define consists in putting the
subject into its genus and then adding the differentiae (Topics 6. 1 39a30).
Thus one can say that, in a way, the differentia is automatically (via
genus and definition) inserted into the list. As far as the species is concerned, Aristotle does not mention it because the species cannot be
predicated of anything, being the ultimate subject of any predication.
Since, however, the species is expressed by the definition, this probably
explains why Porphyry in his lists replaces species with definition.
2.2.:z. The Porphyrian tree
In a long discussion in Posterior Analytics (2. 12.96b25 - 97b15), Aristotle
outlines a series of rules for developing a right division from the most
universal genera to the infimae species, by isolating at every step the right
differentiae.
This is the method carried out by Porphyry in his Isagoge. The fact
that Porphyry develops a theory of division in commenting upon Aristotle's Categories (where the problem of differentia and genus is j ust mentioned) is a matter that requires serious discussion (see Moody 1 935) but
is not relevant for the purposes of the present analysis. We can also
disregard the discussion on the nature of universals, opened by the
Isagoge though the commentary of Boethius. Porphyry says that he intends to "put aside the investigation of certain profound questions,"
namely, whether genera or species exist in themselves or reside in mere
concepts alone. As a matter of fact, he is the first to translate Aristotle's
suggestion on definition under the form of a tree, and it is difficult to
avoid the suspicion that he is portraying ( rather iconically) a Neoplatonic
chain of beings. But we can disregard the metaphysics underlying the
Porphyrian tree, since we are interested in the fact that this tree, i nde-
Dictionary vs. E ncyclopedia [59]
pendent of its alleged metaphysical grounds and conceived as a representation of mere logical relationships, has influenced all subsequent discussions on the method of definition. We are not interested in the
metaphysical persl?ective according to which Porphyry outlines a unique
tree of substances, and it is doubtful whether Aristotle thought in this
way or was more flexibly eager to imagine different and differently structured trees according to the definitory problem he had to solve. Aristotle
deals cautiously with this method of division and , if he seems to appreciate it in the Posterior Anolytics, he seems to be more skeptical in
Ports of Animals (6426bff). Nevertheless, Porphyry designed a unique tree
for substances, and it is from this model that every subsequent idea of a
dictionary-like representation stems.
Porphyry lists five predicables: genus, species, differentia, property,
and accident. The five predicables establish the modes of definition for
all the ten categories (substance plus nine accidents). It is therefore possible to think of ten Porphyrian trees: one for substances, which allows,
for instance, the definition of man as a rational mortal animal, and one
for each of the other nine categories; for instance, a tree of qualities will
allow the definition of purple as a species of the genus 'red' . Aristotle
said that even accidents are susceptible to definition, even though an
accident can be said to have an essence only in reference to substances
(Metaphysics 8. 1 028a10- I OJiaiO). There are, thus, ten possible trees,
but there is not a tree of the ten trees, because the Being is not a
summum genus.
Undoubtedly, the substance-tree proposed by Porphyry aims at being
considered a finite set of genera and species (we will see in which sense
this assumption is untenable); it is not said whether the other nine possible trees are to be finite or not, and Porphyry is rather elusive on this
subject.
The definition Porphyry gives of genus is a purely formal one: a genus
is that to which the species is subordinate. Likewise the species is what
is subordinate to a genus. Thus genus and species are relative to each
other, that is, mutually definable. Any genus posited on a given node of
the tree encompasses its dependent species, but each species becomes
at its turn the genus of another underlying species, and so on, until the
last row of the tree, where the species speciolissimoe or second substances
are located. At the upper node of the tree there is the genus generolissimus
(represented by the name of the category), and this genus cannot be the
species of something else.
Thus every species postulates its upper genus, while the opposite
does not hold. A genus can be 'predicated of' its species, while species
'belong to' their genus. However, a Porphyrian tree cannot be composed
only of genera and species; otherwise, it would assume the format represented in Figure 2.4. (Incidentally, in the Neoplatonic tradition, gods 
[60] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
are listed among bodies and animals because they are intermediate natural forces, not to be identified with the inaccessible and immaterial One.
The Christian medieval tradition adopts this example as a conventional
assumption, more or less as modern logicians assume that the Morning
Star is identical with the Evening Star).

FIGURE 2.4
In a tree of this sort, m a n a n d god, as well as horse and cat, could not
be distinguished from each other. Man is different from god because the
former is mortal and the latter is not. The mortality of man represents
his differentia. Now, the tree of Figure 2.4 does not account for
diff erentiae.
,
In order to u nderstand better the nature of diff erentia, one must carefully distinguish between accident, diff erentia, and proprium. This is a
crucial point, since accidents are not required to produce a definition,
and the 'property' (proprium) has a curious status: it belongs to the species, but it is not required to build up the definition. There are different
types of propria: (a) occurring in one species, although not in every
member of it (as the capability of heal i ng in men); (b) occurring in the
whole species, but not in a single species only (as being two-footed); (c)
occurring in the whole species, and only in a single one, but only at
some time (as being grey in old age); (d) occurring in a whole species,
only in a single one, and at every time (as the capacity of laughing in
man). This last case is the one most frequently quoted in classical literature and has an interesting feature: it is biconditionally equivalent with
its subject (only men are laughing beings, and vice versa). The nature of
proprium remains mysterious, both in Aristotle and in Porphyry, since it
looks like something midway between an essential and analytic property
and an encyclopedic and synthetic one.
Let us come back to the differentia. Differentiae can be separable from 
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [61]
the subject (as to be hot, moving, ill), and in this sense they are mere
accidents. But they can also be inseparable: some of them are inseparable
but still accidental, as to be hook-nosed, but there are differentiae that
belong to the subject per se, or essentially, as being rational, mortal, and
capable of knowledge. These are the specific diff erentiae which are added
to the genus in order to form the definition of the species.
Differentiae can be both divisive and constitutive. For instance, the
genus 'Living Beings' is potentially divisible into the differentiae 'sensitive/insensitive' (endowed or not with sensitivity), but the differentia
'sensitive' can be composed with the genus 'living being' to constitute
the genus 'animal' . The genus 'animal' is divisible into 'rational/ irrational' , but the difference 'rational' is constitutive (along with the genus
it divides) of the species 'animal rational animal' . Thus the differentiae
divide a genus (the genus potentially contains these opposites) and are
selected to constitute in fact a lower genus.
The /sagoge only suggests verbally the idea of the tree, but the
medieval tradition has definitely built it up, as in Figu re 2.5. In the tree
of Figure 2.5, the dotted lines marks the divisive differentiae, while the
continuous lines mark the same differentiae insofar as they are considered constitutive.
:z.:z.J. A tree which is not a tree
It seems that the tree of Figure 2.5 does show the difference between
man and God , but not the one between man and horse. As a matter of
fact, all the instances of a Porphyrian tree, following a common standard,
aim at showing how man can be defined and are therefore incomplete.
In order to isolate the essence of horses, the diagram should display a
different series of disj unctions on its right side so as to isolate (along with
a rational animal) an irrational (and mortal) one. Even in this case, however, a horse could not be distinguished from a dog; one should therefore postulate some complication of the right side of the tree so as to
insert into the diagram many more disjunctions. Aristotle would have
had serious problems in doing so: in Parts of Animals he criticizes the
method of division and, so to speak, provides many possible small trees
according to the specific problem he has to solve.
However, the tree of Figure 2.5 encourages a stronger objection. What
distinguishes God from man is the difference mortal/im mortal; but horse
and man are both mortal and are distinguished by the difference 'rational/irrational' . Therefore one has to choose either of the following alternatives: (a) the differentia 'mortal/im mortal' is not divisive of the genus
'rational animal' but, rather, of the genus 'animal' (but in this first case it
would be impossible to tell the d ifference between man and God); (b)
the differentia 'mortal/immortal' occurs twice, one time under 'rational
animal' and one time under 'irrational animal' .

Porphyry would not have discouraged this second decision, since he
says that the differentia "is often observed in many species, as fourfooted in many animals which differ in species" (18. 20). This is a very
important remark. Also, Aristotle says that, when two or more genera are
subordinate to an upper genus (as it happens to man and horse insofar as
they are both animals), nothing preven ts them from having the same
differentiae (Cat. , I b. I sff; Topics, 4. 1 64b. I O).
In Posterior Analytics (2.90bff) Aristotle shows how it is possible to arrive at an unambiguous definition of the number J. Keeping in mind
that for Greeks I was not a number (but rather the source and the measure of any successive number), the number 3 can be defined as that odd
number which is prime in both senses of being neither measurable by
number nor composed of numbers. This definition is (biconditionally)
equivalent with the expression three. But it is interesting to represent
(Figure 2.6) how Aristotle reaches this conclusion by a careful work of
division.
This sort of division displays two interesting consequences: (a) the
properties registered in italic are not exclusive of a given node but can
occur under more nodes; and (b) a given species (2, 3, 9) can be defined
by the conjunction of more of the above properties. In fact, these properties are differentiae. Thus Aristotle shows by a clear example, not o nly

that many differentiae can be attributed to the same species, but also
that the same couple of diff erentiae can occur under diverse genera. Moreover,
he shows that, once a given difference has served to define unambiguously a given species, one is not obliged to take into account all the
other subjects or which it is predicable : in other words, once one or more
differentiae have served to define without ambiguities the number 3, it
is irrelevant that they can also serve to define the number 2. (For a clear
statement in this sense, see Post. An. 2 . 1 3.97a1 5 - 25 .)
But at this point we can try a further step. Once it has been said that,
given subordinate genera, nothing prevents them from having the same
differentiae, and since the tree of substances is wholly made of genera
that are all subordinate to the uppermost one, it is hard to tell how many
times the same couple of differentiae can occur. In Topics (I. 15. 1 06l!b}
Aristotle says that we can call both a sound and a material substance
'sharp' . It is true that 'sharp' does not mean the same differentia in both
cases, since in the former case it is opposed to 'flat' and in the latter case
to 'dull' (thus the same name is used equivocally for two diverse differentiae). However, the same opposition 'white/black' occurs when one
speaks either of colors or of sou nds. Aristotle is convinced that this
equivocality is a merely lexical one, since the same couple of contraries
is referred to two different cases of sense-perception (sight and hearing).
However, this equivocality is similar to the nonunivocal use of to be for
the propositions men are animals (which is a matter of substantial being)
and these men are white (which is a matter of accident): a case in which
Aristotle speaks of "being used in various senses but with reference to
one central idea" (7Tpor;; ev: Metaphysics 4· wo3 a 3o). This reference to a
central idea will be translated (by medieval philosophers) in terms of analogy, of proportion, not in terms of mere equivocality.
In Topics I. 15. 1 07b30) Aristotle will also say that the couple 'white/ 
[64] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
black' when referred to a body is a species of color, whereas when referred
to a sound it is a diff erentia (for one note differs from the other in being
more or less clear or white). The whole matter is very complex, but how
to avoid the suspicion that the entire universe of differentiae is polluted
by metaphorical ambiguities (be they due to mere equivocali ty or to
analogy)? Is ' two-footed' as referred to man the same as 'two-footed' as
referred to a bird? Is 'rational' as applied to man the same as 'rational' as
applied to God?
2.24 The tree is entirely made up with differentiae
Many medieval com mentators on the Isagoge seem to encourage our
suspicions. Boethius (In /sagogen, C. S. E. L. 256. 10- 12, 266. 13- 15)
writes that ' mortal' can be a differentia for 'irrational animal' and that the
species 'horse' is constituted by the differentia 'irrational and mortal' .
He also suggests that 'im mortal' can be a differentia for celestial bodies
which are inanimate and immortal: "In this case the differentia immortal
is shared between species that differ not only in their proximate genus
but also in all their genera up to the subaltern genus second from the top
of the tree" (Stump 1 978: 257).
According to Stump, the suspicion aroused by Boethius is "surprising"
and "disconcerting" ; in fact, it is only reasonable. Aristotle and Porphyry
say that a differentia is greater (encompasses more) than its subject, and
this could not be if only men were mortal and only gods were immortals.
In order to have such a result 'mortal/immortal' must occur under more
than a genus, and so on for the other differentiae. Otherwise it would be
incomprehensible why (according to Topics 4· 144a25) the species entails
the difference, but the difference does not entail the species: ' mortal' has
a wider extension than 'animal rational and mortal' .
Abelard, in his Editio super Porphyrium (1 57v. 15), suggests that a given
differentia is predicated of more and different species: "falsum est quod
omnis differentia sequens ponit superiores, quia ubi sunt permixtae differentiae, fallit." Thus, given that (a) the same differentia can encompass more species, (b) the same couple of differentiae can occur under
more than one genus, (c) different couples of differentiae can be represented under many genera by using the same names (equivocally or
analogically), and (d) it is an open question how high in the tree the
common genus can be in respect to which many subordinate genera can
host the same differentiae, then one is entitled to reformulate the Porphyrian tree as in Figure 2.7.
The tree of Figure 2. 7 displays many interesting characteristics: (a) it
provides the representation of a possible world in which many new and
still unknown natural kinds can be discovered and defined (for instance,
incorporeal , animate, and irrational substances); (b) it shows that so-

called genera and species are names by which one labels only clusters of
differentiae; (c) according to this tree, one cannot predict that if mortal
then rational, or if irrational then corporeal , and so on; (d) as a consequence of (c) it can be freely reorganized according to alternative hierarchies.
As for the characteristic (a), we have seen what Boethius said apropos
of celestial bodies. As for the characteristic (b), it must be clear that this
tree is composed only of diff erentiae. Genera and species are only the names
that we assign to the nodes represented by d isj unctions of differentiae.
Boethius, Abelard , and other med ieval scholars knew this so well that
they continually complain about the penuria nominum, that is, about the
fact that we do not have enough lexical items to name the nodes of the
tree represented by differentiae added to differentiae of upper differentiae.
Consider the case of the constitutive node obtained by adding the
differentia 'rational' to the genus 'animal' : the tradi tional tree labels this
node with the expression rational animal, which is blatantly red undant
and only repeats the name of the upper genus and of the differentia
constitutive of the unnamed species. This laziness in providing names
for species is rather inconceivable. The medieval i magination could have
coined some new term . But it is a merely empirical circumstance that
somebody found the name /animal/ for labeling the node composed by
adding the difference 'sensitive' to /living being/, which is in turn the
mere name of the composition 'animate + corporeal' . The names of
genera are insufficient because they are mere shorthand: a genus is no
more than a cluster of differentiae . Genera and species are linguistic 
[66] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
ghosts tha'
t cover the real nature of the tree and of the universe it represents: a world of pure differentiae.
Thus, if Aristotle did not list the species among the predicables (since
the species is a sum of genus and differentia), for the same reason also
genera could be eliminated, since they, too, are mere sums of upper
genera and other differentiae.
As for the characteristic (c), since differentiae do not contain each
other, the classical Porphyrian tree (as unveiled in its true nature in
Figure 2. 7) is no longer a hierarchical and ordered structure. It does not
provide any guarantee of being finite.
As for the .characteristic (d), the tree can be continually reelaborated
and rearranged. Since 'mortal' does not contain (necessarily) 'rational' ,
why not put ' mortal' upon 'rational'? Boethius (De divisione 6, 7) says
clearly that this kind of optional division is possible for accidents. We can
say that all white are either hard (pearl) or liquid (milk). But we can at
the same time say that, given the genus of hard things, some of them are
white (pearl) and some of them are black (let us say, ebony); or that,
given the genus of liquid things, some are white (milk) and some are
black (let us say, ink). Therefore Boethius suggests that (at least for
accidents} many trees can be arranged playing upon the same entities, as
shown in Figure 2.8.
white things black things liquid things hard things

liquid hard liquid hard white black white black

milk pearl ink ebony milk ink pearl ebony
FIGURE 2. 8
Boethius, however, says something more (De divisione 37), namely,
that the same freedom of choice holds as far as every genus is concerned.
We can divide numbers between pri me and not prime as well as between
even and odd. We can divide triangles either according to their sides or
according to their angles. "Fit autem generis eiusdem d ivisio multipliciter ... generis unius fit multiplex divisio ... genus una quodammodo
multa rum specierum similitudo, est . . . atque ideo collectivum
plurimarum specierum genus est."
The same is said by Abelard (Editio super Porphyrium I 6ov. I 2 ) : "pluraliter ideo dicit genera, quia animal dividitur per rationale animal et irrationale; et rationale per mortale et immortale dividi tur; et mortale per
rationale et i rrationale dividitur" (that is to say, as in Figure 2.9). In a
tree composed with pure d ifferences, these diffe rences can be rearranged according to the description under which a given subject is considered.

2.2.5. Differentiae as accidents and signs
Differentiae e njoy s uch a singular status because they are accidents, and
accidents are i nfinite , or at least indefinite, in number.
Differentiae are qualities, and it is not by chance that, whereas genera
and species are expressed by common nouns, differentiae are expressed
by adjectives. They belong to a tree different from the one of substances. According to Aristotle, their number cannot be known a priori
(Metaphysics 8.2.6. 1 042b2 - 1 043a). It is true that he says this of nonessential differentiae, but who really knows which differentiae are strictly
essential or specific? Aristotle plays upon a few exam ples (such as rational and mortal, followed by the whole medieval tradition), but when
he speaks of other natural kinds, such as animals, and of artificial objects, he is more vague, so as to make his readers suspect that he could
have never thought of a finite Porphyrian tree.
However, the notion of specific differentia conceals an oxymoron: a
specific differentia is an essential accident. Is it possible to solve such a
philosophical puzzle? The most striking answer to this question is given
by Aquinas. In De Ente et Essentia Aquinas asserts that the differentia
specifica corresponds to the substantial form (the difference corresponds
to the form, and the genus to the matter, and together they make up the
essence of the substance of which they provide the definition). At this
point it would appear rather whimsical to identify an accident (a quality)
with a substantial form, but Aquinas excogitates a brilliant solution: "in
rebus sensibilibus etsi ipsae differentiae essentiales nobis ignotae sunt:
unde significantur per differentiae accidentales quae ex essentialibus
oriuntur, sicut causa significatur per suum effectum, sicut bipes ponit
differentia hominis" (De Ente 6). Essential differences cannot be known
directly by us; we know (we infer! ) them by semiotic means, through the
effects (accidents) they produce, and these accidents are the sign of their
unknowable cause.
This idea is re peated, for instance, in the Summa Theologiae
(1.29.2- 3; or 1 . 77. 1 - 7). Thus we discover that differentiae such as
rational are not the actual substantial form that constitutes the species as
such: Aquinas makes clear that the ratio as potentia animae appears outside verbo et facto, through external actions (and actions are not substances, but accidents); men are told to be rational because they man-
[68] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
ifest their rational potency through their activity of knowing, an activity
that they perform by internal thought and external discourse (I. 79. 8/f).
In a decisive text (Contra Gentiles 3.46), Aquinas says that human beings
do not know what they are (quid est); they know quod est (that they are
so), insofar as they perceive themselves as performing a rational activity.
What in reality our spiritual potencies are, we know "ex ipsorum acruum
qualitate," through the quality of the acts of which they are the potencies.
Thus, 'rational' is an accident, and so we are all the differentiae in
which the traditional Porphyrian tree dissolves itself.
The tree of genera and species, the tree of substances, blows up in a
dust of differentiae, in a turmoil of infinite accidents, in a nonhierarchical network of qualia. The dictionary is dissolved into a potentially unordered and unrestricted gal axy of pieces of world knowledge . The
dictionary thus becomes an encyclopedia, because it was in fact a disguised encyclopedia.
2.3. Encyclopedias
2.3.1. Some attempts: registering contexts and topics
If a dictionary is a disguised encyclopedia, then the only possible representation of the content of a given lexical item cannot be provided except in terms of an e ncycloped ia. If the so-called universals, or
metatheoretical constructs, that work as markers within a dictionary-like
representation are mere linguistic labels that cover more synthetic properties, an encyclopedia-like representation assumes that the representation of the con tent takes place only by means of interpretants, in a process
of unlimited semiosis. These interpretants being in their turn interpretable, there is no bidimensional tree able to represent the global semantic
competence of a given culture. Such a global representation is only a
semiotic postulate, a regulative idea, and takes the format of a multidimensional network that has been described as the Model Q (Eco
1976, 2. 1 2).
Local representations of the Model Q are implemented every time a
given text requires a background encyclopedic knowledge in order to be
interpreted. These local representations of the e ncyclopedic knowledge
assume the form of a set of instructions for the proper textual insertion of
the terms of a language into a series of contexts (as classes of co-texts)
and for the correct disambiguation of the same terms when met within a
give n co-text. An encyclopedic version of componential semantics
should then appear as an Instruktionssemantik which is text-theoretically
oriented (see, for instance, Schmidt 1976).
In A Theory of Semiotics I have outlined a model of componential 
Dictionary vs. E ncyclopedia [69]
analysis in an encyclopedic format, where the spectrum of the sememe
(corresponding to the content of .a given expression) was analyzed in
terms of contextual and circumstantial selections. I have also maintained that
this kind of re p resentation should hol d not only _for so-called
categorematic terms but also for the syncategorematic ones, and I have
provided examples of an instruction-like or a text-oriented analysis of not
only verbal expressions but also indexical signs, as a pointing finger.
In The Role of the Reader I have insisted on the fact that a sememe is a
virtual or potential text and that a text is the expansion of one or more
sememes. The encyclopedic representation of the sememe has been
reinforced with the reference to frames, scripts , and other instructions
concerning coded circumstantial and contextual occurrences. As a consequence, it is clear that an encyclopedic representation, insofar as it is
text-oriented, must take into account this kind of so-called pragmatic
factor as wel l. In an encyclopedic representation, semantics must translate into its own terms most of the phenomena studied by pragmatics.
There are many contextual operators which work exclusively in relation
with a given co-text, but their co-textual fate must be established , foreseen, and predicted by coded contextual selections.
Take a co-textual operator such as the Italian syncategorematic expression linvece/, basically translatable as /instead/. When syntagmatically linked with /di/ (invece di = instead of) it is basically a sentence
operator. Without preposition, /invecel is an adverb and works as a textual operator, and can be translated as /on the contrary/ or /on the other
hand/. As such it seems to express some opposition, but it is doubtful
what it is opposed to. Take the following expressions:
(I) Mary ama le mele. john invece le odia. (Mary loves apples. john on
the other hand hates them. )
(2) Mary ama le mele. lnvece odia le banane. (Mary loves apples. On
the other hand she hates bananas.)
(3) Mary ama le mele . Invece john adora le banane. (Mary loves apples.
john on the other hand is fond of bananas.)
(4) Mary sta suonando il violoncello. john invece sta mangiando banane.
( Mary is playing her 'cello. john on the other hand is eating
bananas.)
We realize that in (I) linvece/ (on the other hand) marks an alternative to
the subject and her action; in (2) it marks an alternative to the action and
to the object; in (3) it marks an alternative to the subject and the object;
in (4) everything seems to be challenged .
Now let us try to insert these expressions into a more comprehensive
co-text; let us look at them as the appropriate answers to the following
questions: 
[70] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
(Ia) Do Mary and John love apples?
(2a) What kind of fruit does Mary love?
(3a) What kind of fruit does John love?
(4a) What the hell are those kids doing? They were supposed to have
their music lesson!
It has repeatedly been asserted (see, for instance, van Dijk 1 977) that
a textual topic can be detected by formulating the implicit question
dominating a given text or portion of a text. That is the case. The four
questions listed above are establishing four d ifferent textual topics,
namely:
(Ib) People who love apples.
(2b) Fruit Mary loves.

(4b) Music lesson.
At this point it is intuitively clear that /invecel (on the other hand) in
( I) is opposed to (lb), in (2) is opposed to (2b), and so on. This means
that our encyclopedic competence has stored a semantic analysis of
/invecel where, after a general semantic marker of alternative, a contextual selection is recorded, such as "in the .cases in which the textual
topic is x, the expression under consideration marks an opposition to X"
(Figure 2. 1 0).
(cont+ ldil + xl (preposition ) 'substitution with x'

FIGURE 2. 10
2.J.2. Some attempts: registering frames and scripts
Nevertheless, there are cases in which such notions as contextual selections are not enough to establish the possible textual insertion of given
lexemes. Take an expression such as the following:
(5) John was sleeping when he was suddenly awakened. Somebody was
tearing up the pillow.
I imagine that a computer fed with dictionary-like information would be
able to understand what /to sleep/ and /pillow/ mean, but would be
unable to establish what the relation is between John and the pillow (and
which pillow?). Current research in Artificial Intelligence has elaborated
the notion of frame (Minsky 1 974; Winston 1977; Schank 1 975 , 1 981 ; 
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [7 1]
van Dijk 1 977): the addressee (be it a computer or a human being) is
endowed with an enlarged encyclopedic competence which encompasses
also a set of frames, or scripts, among which - for instance - are the
frames 'sleeping' and 'bedroom' . By resorting to this storage of competence, the addressee knows that human beings usually sleep in bedrooms and that bedrooms are furnished with beds, beds with pillows,
and so on. By amalgamation of two or more frames, the addressee
realizes that the pillow just mentioned can only be the one John was
resting his head on.
To what extent can one assume that the frames, too, are elements of
an encyclopedia-like componential analysis (an extremely rich one indeed)? Do they belong to a sort of additional competence (that which is
called overcoding in Eco 1 976)? Probably the very notion of the encyclopedia has to be revised and reorganized according to different rates of
social accessibility or of textual necessity. For instance, when reading
John was sleeping and was dreaming of . . . , one does not need to have
recourse to the frame 'bedroom' (even though one shares this piece of
knowledge), and only the co-text leads one to blow up and to narcotize
given sememes or frames (see Eco 1 979).
The notio n of frame ( be fore being postulated by the empirical
engineering of Artificial Intelligence scientists) was already indirectly
advocated by Peirce. Take, for instance, his example of a possible definition of lithium. According to a general dictionary (Webster's New Collegiate), lithium is "a soft silver-white element of the alkali metal group
that is the lightest metal known and that is used esp. in nuclear reactions
and metallurgy " (I have s tressed the most evident elements of
encyclopedic information).
According to a scientific handbook, lithium is definable as that element which has an atomic number 3, atomic weight 6. 393 , fusion point
1 08.5 degrees centigrade, boiling point 1 330 degrees centigrade, density
0.53. This second definition, even though expressed in technical jargon,
looks more similar to the following definition given by Peirce than it
does to the one given by Webster:
If you look into a textbook of chemistry for a definition of lithium you may
be told that it is that element whose atomic weight is 7 very nearly. But if
the author has a more logical mind he will tell you that if you search among
minerals that are vitreous, translucent, gray or white, very hard, brittle, and
insoluble for one which imparts a crimson tinge to an unluminous flame,
this mineral being triturated with lime or witherite rats-bane, and then
fused, can be partly dissolved in muriatic acid; and if this sol ution be evaporated, and the residue be extracted with sulphuric acid , and duly purified, it
can be converted by ordinary methods into a chloride, which being obtained
in the solid state, fused and electrolyzed with half a dozen powerful cells, 
[72] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
will yield a globule of a pinkish silvery metal that will float on gasolcne; and
the material of that is a specimen of lithiu m. The pecu liarity of this
defi ni tio n - or ra ther this p rece pt that is more servicea ble than a
definition - is that it tells you what the word lithium denotes by prescribing
what you are to do in order to gain a perceptual acquaintance with the object
of the world . (C. P. 2.330)
This 'operational' definition looks more like an informal frame than an
encyclopedic description (for descriptions of this kind , see Charniak
1 975, 1 980). It satisfies the needs of an Instruktionssemantik. Gathering
together the definition of Webster and that of Peirce, one is able to
understand why, let us suppose, in a text a certain Professor Smith
should need lithium for an atomic experiment and look for lime or
witherite rats-bane. A textual assertion of this type undoubtedly elicits a
lot of presuppositions, but these presuppositions are governed by
preexisting frames.
Therefore , when a text theory aims to establish a "frame for frames"
(Petofi 1 976), it is attempting both to discover textual rules and to set up
a more organized and comprehensive notion of code as encyclopedic
knowledge.
Schank and Abelson (1977) attempt to represent not only the lexical
meaning of a given expression but also all the connected forms of world
knowledge that allow the interpreter to draw (from the utterance of a
term or of a sentence made up with the analyzed terms) co-textual inferences. Thus (through the use of certain primitives representing fundamental human operations, such as ATRANS , EJECT, INGEST, MOVE, and
so on) Schank represents the verb to eat as an item susceptible of being
inserted into contexts such as John ate a frog ( Figure 2. I I ). t mouth, John,
o t 1 a John ,# INGEST-frog , th # PART (JOHN ,

An interesting semiotic problem (which has escaped the notice of Artificial Intelligence theorists up to now) is the question of how to interpret in their turn not only the primitives expressed verbally but also the
visual expressions of the diagram in Figure 2 . 1 0. In a general semiotic
framework, a linguistic term can be interpreted by nonlinguistic interpretants, but even these interpretants are semiotic devices which must
be in turn interpreted. In Eco (1976, 3.6. 5) they have been studied as
topo-sensitive vectors. 
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [73]
The project for an encyclopedic semantics is still in progress. Up to
now we have been witnessing a series of alternative or complementary
proposals. The structural semantics of Greimas (1966, 1 979), with its
notion of actant and of classemes or contextual semes, as well as with the
idea of 'narrative programs' , is encyclopedia-oriented; the early case
grammar of Fillmore (1968), along with the more recent researches of
Fillmore (1975 , 1 976a, 1976b, 1977, 1981), as well as the proposals by
Bierwisch (1970, 1 971), are encyclopedia-oriented. A new semantics in
terms of encyclopedia and world knowledge (and phenomenological experience) is evident in the last researches of Lakoff (1980) and Lakoff
and Johnson (1980).
Since all of these representations concern coded sequences of actions,
relationships between agents (actors or abstract actants), they can be retraced together to the idea of frame.
:z.J.J. Some attempts: stereotypes and commonsense knowledge
Undoubtedly, any encyclopedia-like semantics must blur the distinctions
between analytic and synthetic properties, and in this sense nothing better has been said after and beyond Quine's "Two Dogmas of E mpiricism" (1951). �aturally, nothing prevents one from using analytical
markers, provided one knows that they are shorthand devices used in
order to include other analytic properties they entail and to summarize
all the synthetic markers they name (in the same way as the names of
genera, in a Porphyrian tree, name clusters of accidental properties or
differentiae). In this sense, the proposal of Putnam (1975) is more than
acceptable:
The normal form of description of the meaning of a word should be a finite
sequence, or 'vector' , whose components should certainly include the following (it might be desirable to have othe r types of components as well): (I)
the syntactic markers that apply to the word, e.g. , 'noun' ; (2) the semantic
markers that apply to the word, e.g. , 'animal', 'period of time' ; (3) a description of the additional feature of the stereotype, if any; (4) a description
of the extension. The following convention is a part of this proposal: the
components of the vector all represent a hypothesis about the individual
speaker's competence, except the exte11Sion. Thus the normal form description
for 'water' m ight be, in part:
Sy11tactic
markers
mass noun,
concrete
Semantic markers
natu ral kind
liquid
Stereotype
colorless
transparent
tasteless
thirstquenching
etc.
Extension
H20
(give or take
impurities) 
[74] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
The idea of the stereotype represents probably the most fruitful suggestion coming from Putnam's theory of language: according to our normal competence it is doubtful whether tigers are 'felidae' or 'felis tigris'
or ' metazoa' , but they are undoubtedly 'yellow' , 'like a big cat' , and
'black striped' .
Semantic markers are pseudoanalytic shorthand labels, since there
should be a stereotype also for 'liquid' and perhaps for 'natural' .
As for the extension, Putnam's proposal is dependent on his sharing of
Kripke's theory of rigid designation (Kripke 1 972). It is hard to say
whether Putnam's idea of rigid designation really corresponds to that of
Kripke; Putnam thinks of the something rigidly designated by a linguistic term as an essence that can be defined in scientific terms. However,
such an expression as 'H20' is composed by chemical symbols, which, in
turn correspond to linguistic terms such as /hydrogen/ and /oxygen/,
and these should in turn be interpreted in terms of other formulas or
chemical symbols (or expressions of natural language) expressing the
properties of these elements (atomic number, atomic structure, plus
many of their functional properties - for instance, that oxygen is the
element that permits combustion, and so on) .
.
As a matter of fact, the ultimate referent of a rigid designation ( intended as the possible extension of a given term) can be defined in two
ways. If rigid designation is (as Kripke seems to suggest) a process of
mentions leading backward to an initial and aboriginal baptismal ceremony (and therefore to a primeval act of ostension accompanied by the
utterance of the name), then the chain of mediatory information that
guarantees the link with the original christening is made up of an uninterrupted series of discourses, descriptions, stories told about other
stories up to the initial event; and in this case there is no difference
between rigid designation and the encylcopedia, the sum of all these
links representing the encylcopedic competence of a society in its very
progress through time.
But the process of rigid designation can also be described in the terms
used by Putnam (1975 : 200). Suppose, suggests Putnam, that I were
standing next to Benjamin Franklin when he made his experiment on
electricity and that Franklin told me that 'electricity' is phenomenon so
and so. He would have given me an approximately correct definite description of the phenomenon. Now when I use the term /electricity/, I
refer to the introducing event, the moment I learned that term, and everyone of my uses of the name will be causally connected to that event,
even though I forgot when I first learned what I know about that name.
Now suppose that I teach someone the word by telling him that the term
/electricity/ names a physical magnitude so and so (listing some properties of the magnitude) without mentioning the causal link occurring between my present use of the word and the introducing event. The being 
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [75]
of this word in someone's vocabulary will still be causally connected to the
introducing event. E nd of Putnam's example.
Even in this case, what makes my (and someone's) language work is
not the introducing event but the encyclopedic set of more or less definite descriptions I was able to provide (and that Franklin was able to
give me). The introducing event was something similar to Peirce's
Dynamic Object (intending the Dynamic Object both as electricity as
physical magnitude and as my original experience of it). But what permits communication between me, Putnam, and someone else is the outline, via definite descriptions, of an Immediate Object, which is the
encyclopedic representation of /electricity/. It would be possible that
among the interpretants of the word /electricity/ there be also a photograph of Putnam speaking with Franklin; as a matter of fact, among my
own (Eco's) interpretants of /electricity/, there are some images of
Franklin performing his experiment. But, since even introducing events
can be spoken of through interpretants (disregarding the fact that even
Putnam's memories of his own introducing event, if any, could be
viewed as mental interpretants or mental icons), what remains is only an
encyclopedic chain.
Finally, if the introducing event described by Putnam really took
place (in the way he describes it in Putnam 1 975: 200), the only things
one can semiotically test are just the printed expressions at page 200 of
Putnam 1 975, along with their interpretable content.
There is a further objection to the theory of rigid designation (at least
such as it is proposed by Kripke and by many of his interpreters). Maybe
we call a halibut halibut because of a first baptismal ceremony, and a
halibut will still be a halibut (with an essence of its own, as Putnam
suggests) even though we change by counteffactual conditionals every
possible definite description of it. Let us accept this view. Now let us
suppose that, in order to avoid future world wars, the United Nations
decided to establish a Peace Corps of ISC (Inter-Species Clones). This
corps will be composed by half-human beings, to be produced by cloning, through a genetic hybridation of human punk rockers and speaking
chimps trained in ASL. Such clones would guarantee a fair and unbiased
international control, because they are independent of any national or
ethnic heritage . The UN Assembly has to speak a lot about this new
'natural kind' because the members must reach a final agreement - that
is, they have to speak about ISCs before ISCs exist, and just in order to
make them exist. It is clear that, if there were any baptismal ceremony,
what the UN christened as ISC was not an original 'thing' , but the
encyclopedic description of such a thing. There was neither original ostension, nor causal link; there will be only an established correspondence between an expression and the operational description of its
content (with the understanding that, in the future, such an expression, 
[76] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
along with its content, will be used in order to mention some state of
affairs , as yet merely possible).
It is evident that we use linguistic expressions or other semiotic means
to name 'things' first met by our ancestors; but it is also evident that we
frequently use linguistic expressions to describe and to call into life
'things' that will exist only after and because of the utterance of our
expressions. In these cases, at least, we are making recourse more to
stereotypes and encyclopedic representations than to rigid designators.
Many of Putnam's suggestions (for instance, the distinction between
stereotyped knowledge and expert knowledge) are accepted by Petofi's
theory of encyclopedical representation. Let us consider, for instance,
the ten tative representation ( Figure 2. 12) of chlorine pro posed by
Neubauer and Petofi (1980: 367). Chlorine is more interesting than electricity because we have good reasons to believe that not even Putnam
was witnessing i ts baptismal ceremony when Scheele christened it in
1774. (Incidentally, I suspect that he baptized it in German as Chlor, and
this fact shuffles the causal chain. )
One can say that the fact that chlorine is a gas is a piece of common
knowledge as well as the fact that it is a disinfectant. But Petofi's proposal is tentative: the difference between commonsense knowledge and
expert knowledge should be traced each time according to the specific
co-text. What is important is to assume that all the items of information
listed ( Figure 2. 11) are part of a possible linguistic competence, irrespective of the difference between dictionary and encyclopedia. There
are novels in which many of the 'industrial' properties of chlorine are
more i mportant than the one of being a chemical element. (Incidentally,
Petofi records as commonsense knowledge what Putnam would record as
semantic information, since to be an element is an 'analytical' property. )
The advantage of Petofi's model over Putnam's is that the former
definitely gives up the distinction between intension and extension. Any
item of expert knowledge can be intended as a meaning component that
serves to establish the extension of the term under certain circumstantial
conditions: since we are not living on the Twin Earth (see Pu tnam
1975 ), when someone is invited to look in some closet for some chlorine,
it is enough that he looks for a greenish liquid , disagreeable to smell,
and his subsequent indexical assertion there is some chlorine can be evaluated in terms of truth values even according to Tarskian criteria.
There are many other models for an encyclopedic representation, and ,
at the present state of the art, it would be embarrassing to decide which
one is the more suitable. Rey-Debove (1971) speaks, apropos of the
work of lexicographers and of their 'natural' definitions, of bricolage; she
also remarks that, looking at the existing dictionaries, it seems that it is
easier to define infrequent expressions such as /infarct/ than frequent
ones such as /to do/. A semiotic encyclopedia, even though only de-

signed under the form of local examples, is subjected to the same restrictions. However, the choice of the encyclopedia over the dictionary is
not a free one: we have shown that dictionaries cannot exist if not as
theoretical figments. The universe of natural languages (and not only of
verbal ones) is the universe of semiosis. The regulative idea of encyclo-
[78] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
pedia is the only way to outline a possible format of such a universe and
to try tentative devices for describing part of it.
:Z.J.4· Clusters
According to the last representation we have exami ned , it is clear that,
when the content of an expression is represented in the format of encyclopedia, there is no way to establish - out of any context - a hierarchy
among properties. In Figure 2.3 we have refrained from inserting sexual
differences into the tree. After the critique of the Porphyrian tree, we
are now in the position of understanding the reason for this act of prudence. When differences like the sexual ones are taken as specific differentiae (a decision that Porphyry would not have encouraged), they
can occur in many nodes of the tree, so compromising once again its
structu re. Following the suggestion of Boethius (2.4), one can play upon
the opposition 'male/female' in many ways (for example, as shown in
Figure 2. 13), so creating (according to different contexts) different oppositions, antonymies, and semantic similarities.
At this point, which kind of information is deleted by a negative
statement such as this is not a man.?

Katz designs, for an ideal dictionary competence, a criterion: "an ideal
speaker of a language receives an anonymous letter containing just one
sentence in that language, with no clue about the motive, circumstances
of transmission, or any other factor relevant to understand ing the
sentence on the basis of its context of utterance ... " (1977: 14). This
criterion draws a sharp line that divides semantic (dictionary) competence and pragmatic and encyclopedic competence. The semantic component represents only those aspects of meaning that an ideal speaker/
hearer would know in such an anonymous letter situation.
Now, we can certainly admit that an anonymous letter reading when
you will enter that log cabin you will find a man is absolutely unambiguous.
Accordi ng to the d ictionary he or she refers to, the addressee will be sure
to meet, in that log cabin, either an adult male human being or a mortal
rational animal. The situation turns out badly if the anonymous letter
reads whatever you will find entering that log cabin it will not be a man. What
should one expect to see in that place? A woman, a crocodile, a ghost, a
bronze statue? 
Dictionary vs . Encyclopedia [79]
Since the speakers of natural languages have few opportunities of receiving anonymous letters, let us consider a more 'normal' situation.
During the night, looking out of the window of her home in the countryside, a wife tells her h usband : Honey, there is a man on the lawn near the
fence! Now, suppose that her husband controls the situation and answers:
No, honey, it's not a man . . . . It would be absolutely unclear what the
husband means, what he is negating and what survives his negation.
The 'thing' in the lawn can be a boy, a boa constrictor escaped from the
nearby zoological garden, a tree, an alien invader, a dog, the giant teddy
bear left there by their children, the shadow of a tree.
Naturally, the husband can have the intention of scaring his wife by
producing a feeling of uneasiness and suspense; but, in this case, we are
no longer concerned with semantic questions, but with a more complex
pragmatic strategy based on reticence. The husband, in this case, exploits
the nature of the encyclopedia in order to achieve a rhetorical effect.
However, we are now considering the case in which the h usband
really wants to say something 'clear' in order to communicate to his wife
that he actually thinks about the thing in the lawn. He should then say
that that thing is not a man but (alternatively) a boy, a dog, a spatial
creature, a tree, and so on. In doing so, he has not to go on without a
dictionary; he must simply build up and presuppose the same 'local'
portion of dictionary he assumed as implicitly outlined by his wife in
uttering her sentence. The husband must make some conjectu re or abduction about the ad hoc dictionary that both speakers, in that situation,
take for granted . Once having evaluated the situation of the u tterence,
the husband has reasonably conjectured that, by uttering man, his wife
was magnifying or blowing up certain semantic properties and narcotizing
some others (see Eco 1 979, 0.6.2).
Probably the wife was not interested in the fact that men are mortal or
hot-blooded animals; she was interested in their being rational only insofar as to be rational means to be able to conceive evil intentions. In
other words, a man was to her something potentially aggressive, able to
move inside. If the thing were a child , it would be felt as nonpotentially
aggressive; if it were a dog, it would be felt as unable to intrude; if it
were a tree or a giant teddy bear, it would be felt as unable to move. On
the contrary, a spatial alien would be viewed as a moving and potentially
aggressive being. We can also suppose that each alternative elicits the
retrieval of a given frame such as 'burglars in the night' , 'lost child' ,
'space invaders' , 'the thing from the outer world' , and so on.
Thus the husband is committed to utter, along with the negation of
man, the assertion of some other being that does not contain one or more
of the frightening properties. Consequently, he should figure out an ad
hoc Porphyrian tree, more or less in the format of the one in Figure 2. 14. 
[80] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
The encyclopedia is the regulative hypothesis that allows both speakers to figure out the 'local' dictionary they need in order to ensure the
good standing of their communicative interaction. The success of the
interaction will eventually prove that their hypothesis was the good one.
Moreover, even if the husband wanted to implement a strategy of reticence , he equally needed this hypothesis, in order to know how to
create the due suspense. He had to know that by deleting man he was
excluding that the thing in the lawn was a human, dangerous, walking
thing, but he was not excluding that it was a nonhuman, dangerous,
walking thing.
A natural language is a flexible system of signification conceived for
producing texts, and texts are devices for blowing up or narcotizing
pieces of encyclopedic information.

2.J.s. The encyclopedia as labyrinth
tree or
teddy bear
The project of an encyclopedia competence is governed by an underlying metaphysics or by a metaphor (or an allegory): the idea of labyrinth.
The u topia of a Porphyrian tree represented the most influencial attempt
to red uce the labyrinth to a bidimensional tree. But the tree again generated the labyrinth.
There are th ree types of labyrinth. The first, the classical one, was
linear. Theseus entering the labyrinth of Crete had no choices to make:
he could not but reach the center, and from the center the way out.
That is the reason by which at the center there was the Minotaur, to
make the whole thing a little more exciting. Such a labyrinth is ruled by
a blind necessity. Structurally speaking, it is simpler than a tree: it is a
skein, and, as one unwinds a skein, one obtains a continuous line. In
this kind of labyrinth the Ariadne thread is useless, since one cannot get
lost: the labyrinth itself i tself is an Ariadne thread . This kind of
labyrinth has nothing to do with an encyclopedia, irrespective of its important and venerable symbolic meanings.
The second type is called in German lrrgiirten or lrrweg; a good E n-
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [81]
gl ish term for i t i s maze. The maze is a Manneristic invention; iconological ly speaking, it does not appear before the late Renaissance. A maze
displays choices between alternative paths, and some of the paths are
dead ends. In a maze one can make mistakes. If one unwinds a maze,
one gets a particular kind of tree in which certain choices are privileged
in respect to others. Some alternatives end at a point where one is obliged to return backwards, whereas others generate new branches, and
only one among them leads to the way out. In this kind of labyrinth, one
does need an Ariadne thread ; otherwise, one might spend one's life in
turning around by repeating the same moves. A Porphyrian tree can become a maze of this type, especially if reformulated as in 2.4. A maze
does not need a Minotaur: it is its own Minotaur: in other words, the
Minotaur is the visitor's trial-and-error process.
In a labyrinth of the third type is a net (maybe the word meander
characterizes it as different from a maze and from a plain labyrinth ). The
main feature of a net is that every point can be connected with every
other point, and , where the connections are not yet designed, they are,
however, conceivable and designable. A net is an unlimited territory. A
net is not a tree. The territory of the United States does not oblige
anybody to reach Dallas from New York by passing through St. Louis,
Missouri; one can also pass through New Orleans. A net - as Pierre
Rosenstiehl (1980) suggests - is a tree plus corridors connecting its nodes
so as to transform the tree into a polygon, or into a system of embedded
polygons. But this comparison is still misleading: a polygon has some
borderlines. On the contrary, the abstract model of a net has neither a
center nor an outside.
The best image of a net is provided by the vegetable metaphor of the
rhizome suggested by Deleuze and Guattari (1976). A rhizome is a
tangle of bulbs and tubers appearing like "rats squirming one on top of
the other." The characteristics of a rhizomatic structure are the following: (a) Every point of the rhizome can and must be connected with
every other point. (b) There are no points or positions in a rhizome;
there are only lines (this feature is doubtful: intersecting li nes make
points). (c) A rhizome can be broken off at any point and reconnected
following one of its own lines. (d) The rhizome is antigenealogical. (e)
The rhizome has its own outside with which it makes another rhizome;
therefore , a rh izomatic whole has neither outside nor inside. (f) A
rhizome is not a calque but an open chart which can be connected with
something else in all of its dimensions; it is dismountable, reversible,
and s usceptible to continual modifications. (g) A network of trees which
open in every direction can create a rhizome (which seems to us equivalent to saying that a network of partial trees can be cut out artificially in
every rhizome). (h) No one can provide a global description of the whole 
[82] 'SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
rhizome; not only because the rhizome is multidimensionally complicated, but also because i ts structu re changes through the time;
moreover, in a structure in which every node can be connected with
every other node, there is also the possibility of contradictory inferences:
if p, then any possible consequence of p is possible, including the one
that, instead of leading to new consequences, leads again to p, so that it
is true at the same time both that if p, then q and that if p, then non-q. (i)
A structure that cannot be described globally can only be described as a
potential sum of local descriptions. (j) In a structure without outside, the
describers can look at it only by the inside; as Rosenstiehl ( 197 1, 1 980)
suggests, a labyrinth of this kind is a myopic algorythm; at every node of it
no one can have the global vision of all its possibilities but only the local
vision of the closest ones: every local description of the net is a
hypothesis, subject to falsification, about its further course; in a rhizome
blindness is the only way of seeing (locally), and thinking means to grope
one's way. This is the type of labyrinth we are interested in. This represents a model (a Model Q) for an encyclopedia as a regulative semiotic
hypothesis.
A midway solution between the tree and the rhizome was the one
proposed by the Encyclopedists of the Enlightenment. Trying to transform the tree into a map, the eighteenth-century encyclopedia, the
Encyclopedie of Diderot and of d' Alembert, made in fact the rhizome
thinkable.
In respect to its hierarchical structure, the eighteenth-century encyclopedia was not necessarily different from a tree. What does make it
distinct is, in the first place, the hypothetical nature of the tree: it does
not reproduce a presumed structure of the world, but presents itself as
the most economic solution with which to confront and resolve a particular problem of the reunification of knowledge. In the second place, the
encyclopedist knows that the tree organizes, yet impoverishes, its content, and he hopes to determine as precisely as he can the intermediary
paths between the various nodes of the tree so that little by little it is
transformed into a geographical chart or a map.
D' Alembert, in his preliminary discourse on the Encyclopedie, furnished information about the criteria for the organization of the work. In
one respect, he develops the metaphor of the tree; in another, he puts it
into question, speaking instead of a word map and a labyrinth:
The general system of the sciences and arts is a kind of labyrinth, a tortuous road which the spirit faces without knowing too much about the path to
be followed.
But this disorder (however philosophical it be for the mind) would disfigure, or at least would entirely degrade an encyclopedic tree in which it 
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [83]
would be represented. Our system of knowledge is ultimately made up of
different branches, many of which have a simple meeting place and since in
departing from this point it is not possible to simultaneously embark on all
the roads, the determination of the choice is up to the nature of the individual spirit .... However, the same thing does not occur in the encyclopedic
order of our knowledge which consists in reuniting this knowledge in the
smallest possible space and in placing the philosopher above this vast
labyrinth in a very elevated point of perspective which would enable him to
view with a single glance his object of speculation and those operations
which he can perform on those objects to distinguish the general branches of
human knowledge and the points dividing it and uniting it and even to
detect at times the secret paths which unite it. It is a kind of world map
which must show the principal countries, their position and their reciprocal
dependencies. It must show the road in a straight line which goes from one
point to another; a road often interrupted by a thousand obstacles which
might only be noticed in each country by travelers and its inhabitants and
which could only be shown in very detailed maps. These partial maps will
be the different articles of the encyclopedia and the tree or the figurative
system will be its world map. Yet like overall maps of the world on which we
live, the objects are more or less adjacent to one another and they present
different perspectives according to the point of view of the geographer composing the map. In a similar way, the form of the encyclopedic tree will
depend on the perspective we impose on it to examine the cultural universe. One can therefore imagine as many different systems of human
knowledge as there are cartographical projections.
D' Alembert says with great clarity that what an encyclopedia represents has no center. The encyclopedia is a pseudotree, which assumes
the aspect of a local map, in order to represent, always transitorily and
locally, what in fact is not representable because it is a rhizome - an
inconceivable globality.
The universe of semiosis, that is, the u niverse of human culture, must
be conceived as structured like a labyrinth of the third type: (a) It is
structured according to a network of interpretants. (b) It is virtually infinite
because it takes into account multiple interpretations realized by different cultures: a given expression can be interpreted as many times, and in
as many ways, as it has been actually interpreted in a given cultural
framework; it is infinite because every discourse about the encyclopedia
casts in doubts the previous structure of the encyclopedia itself. (c) It
does not register only 'truths' but, rather, what has been said about the
truth or what has been believed to be true as well as what has been
believed to be false or imaginary or legendary, provided that a given
culture had elaborated some discourse about some subject matter; the
encyclopedia does not register only the 'historical' truth that Napoleon
died on Saint Helena but also the 'literary' truth that Juliet died in Ver-
[84] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
ona. (d) Such a semantic encyclopedia is never accomplished and exists
only as a regulative idea; it is only on the basis of such a regulative idea
that one is able actually to isolate a given portion of the social encyclopedia so far as it appears useful in order to interpret certain portions of
actual discourses (and texts). (e) Such a notion of encyclopedia does not
deny the existence of structured knowledge; it only suggests that such a
knowledge cannot be recognized and organized as a global system; it
provides only 'local' and transitory systems of knowledge, which can be
contradicted by alternative and equally 'local' cultural organizations;
every attempt to recognize these local organizations as unique and
'global' - ignoring their partiality - produces an ideological bias.
The Porphyrian tree tried to tame the labyrinth. It did not succeed
because it could not, but many contemporary theories of language are
still trying to revive this impossible dream.
:z.J.6. The dictionary as a tool
After having demonstrated that the theoretical idea of a semantic representation in the format of a dictionary is untenable, we should, however,
remind ourselves that dictionary-like representations can be used as suitable tools.
The system of hyperonyms provided by a dictionary represents a way
to save 'definitional energies' . When one says that a rose is a flower, one
does not suggest that 'flower' is a primitive that cannot be interpreted ;
one simply assumes that, for the sake of economy, in that specific context, all the properties that are commonly assigned to flowers should not
be challenged. Otherwise, one would say a rose is a flower, but. . . .
In the example of husband and wife provided above (2. 3.4), the husband knows that there is no absolute and unique representation of man,
but - exactly because of this - he is obliged to figure out an ad hoc
dictionary-like local representation in order to ensure the good standing
of that conversational interaction. In Chapter 3 of this book we shall see
that, in order to generate and to interpret metaphors, according to the
model proposed , one must rely also on dictionary-like representations.
D' Alembert has suggested that, in order to make up a flesh-and-body
encyclopedia, one certainly knows that each of its items can be included
in different classes according to the description under which it is considered, but at the end (and even though transitorily) an item must be
included in a given class, thus 'freezing' its representation in the format
of a provisional dictionary.
When Putnam lists 'liquid' among the semantic markers of water, he
uses that hyperonym because he assumes that, in order to provide a
definition of water, he is not interested in challenging all the properties
that are usually assigned to liquids. It is by virtue of this shorthand deci-
Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia [85]
sion that he can exclude from the stereotypical properties of water those
of being physically perceptible, wet, and subject to evaporation; he assumes that these are all properties that we assign to liquids without challenging them - until the moment that a sudden change in the scientific
paradigm will oblige our culture to cast in doubt the very notion of liquid . The function of hyperonyms in a lexical system depends exactly on
the epistemological decisions that govern the life of a culture. We can
make up dictionary-like representation in order to save definitional
energies in any context in which certain 'central' assumptions of a cultural system are taken for granted. We presuppose a local dictionary every
time we want to recognize and to circumscribe an area of consensus
within which a given discourse should stay, because no single discourse
is designed to change globally our world view.
Thus, if the encyclopedia is an unordered set of markers (and of
frames, scripts, text-oriented instructions), the d ictionary-like arrangements we continuously provide are transitory and pragmatically
useful hierarchical reassessments of it. In this sense, one should turn
upside down a current distinction between d ictionary (strictly 'semantic')
and encyclopedia (polluted with 'pragmatic' elements); on the contrary,
the encyclopedia is a semantic concept and the dictionary is a pragmatic device.
One could wonder about a more profound reason for all this. One can
legitimately ask whether there is a 'universal' or 'biological' reason by
which certain properties seem to be more 'dictionarial' than others. Undoubtedly, we frequently challenge the opinion that men are cruel or
reasonable and that dogs are men's best friends, but less frequently we
challenge the common and strong belief that both are animals. Quine
(1951) has already answered this question: every culture has a strongly
organized 'center' and a more and more fuzzy 'periphery' , and , in order
to change i ts central concepts , one must expect a rad ical scientific revolution. Certain d ictionary properties are such - and more resistantly remain as such - by virtue of this cultural inertia. These properties are not
'dictionarial' on logical or biological grounds, but on historical grounds.
Our representations usually respect this heritage, for many intu itive reasons. Many properties that inhabit the higher nodes of so many
dictionary-like trees (such as 'living being' or 'body' or 'physical') have
been profoundly rooted in the world view of our culture for millennia. It
is not impossible, however, to think of a new discourse in which these
concepts become the target of a critical deconstruction of our cultural
paradigm. Chapter 3, on metaphor, will show that sometimes a poetic
text aims at destroying exactly our most unchallengable assumptions; in
these cas_es it can happen that colorless green ideas can (and maybe must)
sleep furiously, and we are obliged to suspect that perhaps ideas are
more 'physical' than we usually believe. Thus the interpretation of a 
[86] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
metaphorical text requires the greatest flexibility, on the part of the interpreter, in rearranging the most venerable and higher nodes of current
d ictionaries.
In more common contexts, one can decide that certain properties are
more 'focal' , more 'central ', more 'diagnostic' , more resistant than
others. Once having recognized that the dictionary is not a stable and
univocal image of a semantic universe, one is free to use it when one
needs it.

METAPH OR
J.I . The metaphoric nexus
The " most luminous and therefore the most necessary and frequent"
(Vico) of all tropes, the metaphor, defies every encyclopedic entry. It
has been the object of phi losophical , linguistic, aesthetic, and psychological reflection since the beginning of time. Shibles' (1971) bibliography
on the metaphor records around 3,000 titles; and yet it overlooks authors
such as Fontanier, and almost all of Heidegger and Greimas - and of
course it cannot mention, after the research in componential semantics,
the successive studies on the logic of natu ral languages, the work of
Henry, Groupe f.L of Lieges, Ricoeur, Samuel Levi n, and the latest
text-linguistics and pragmatics.
The term metaphor for many authors - and this is true for Aristotle and
E manuele Tesauro - has served to indicate every rhetorical figure in
general; the metaphor, as the Venerable Bede put it, is "a genus of
which all the other tropes are species." To speak of metaphor, therefore,
means to speak of rhetorical activity in all its complexity. And it means,
above all, to ask oneself whether it is out of blindness, laziness, or some
other reason that this peculiar synecdochic view of metaphor has arisen,
whereby the part is taken as representative of the whole. It is very difficult indeed to consider the metaphor without seeing it in a framework
that necessarily includes both synecdoche and metonymy - so difficult,
in fact, that a trope that seems to be the most primary will appear instead as the most derivative, as the result of a semantic calculus that
presupposes other, preliminary semiotic operations. A curious situation
for a figure of speech that has been recognized by many to be the basis
of every other.
[87] 
[88] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
Not the least of the contradictions encountered in a metaphorology is
that, of the thousands and thousands of pages written about the
metaphor, few add anything of substance to the first two or three fundamental concepts stated by Aristotle. In effect, very little has been said
about a phenomenon concerning which, it seems, there is everything to
say. The chronicle of the discussion on metaphors is the chronicle of a
series of variations on a few tautologies, perhaps on a single one: "A
metaphor is that artifice which permits one to speak metaphorically."
Some of these variations, however, constitute an 'epistemic break' ,
allowing the concepts to drift toward new territories - ever so slightly,
but just enough. It is with these variations that we shall be concerned .
Every d iscourse on metaphor originates in a radical choice: either (a)
language is by nature, and originally, metaphorical, and the mechanism
of metaphor establishes linguistic activity, every rule or convention arisi ng thereafter in order to discipline, to reduce (and impoverish) the
metaphorizing potential that defines man as a symbolic animal; or (b)
language (and every other semiotic system) is a rule-governed mechanism, a predictive machine that says which phrases can be generated and
which not, and which from those able to be generated are 'good' or
'correct' , or endowed with sense; a machine with regard to which the
metaphor constitutes a breakdown, a malfu nction, an u naccountable
outcome, but at the same time the drive toward linguistic renewal. As
can be seen, this opposition retraces the classical one between phusis and
nomos, between analogy and anomaly, motivation and arbitrariness. But
the problem is to see what ensues when we accept one or the other of
the two horns of this dilemma. If it is metaphor that founds language, it
is impossible to speak of metaphor unless metaphorically. Every definition of metaphor, then, cannot but be circular. If instead there exists
first a theory of language that prescribes 'literal' linguistic outputs, and if
within this theory the metaphor constitutes a scandal (that is, if the
metaphor is a deviation from such a system of norms), then the theoretical metalanguage must speak of something to define which has not even
been devised. A merely denotative theory of language can indicate those
cases where language is incorrectly used but appears to say something - but such a theory is embarrassed to explain what and why. Consequently, it reaches for tautological definitions of the following type:
"There is a metaphor every time something unexplainable happens
which the users of a language perceive as a metaphor."
But the problem does not end there. When closely studied in connection with verbal language, the metaphor becomes a source of scandal in a
merely linguistic framework, because it is in fact a semiotic phenomenon
permitted by almost all semiotic systems. The inner nature of metaphors
produces a shifting of the linguistic explanation onto semiotic mecha-
Metaphor [89]
nisms that are not peculiar to spoken languages; one need only think of
the frequently metaphorical nature of oneiric images. However, it is not
a matter of saying that visual metaphors also exist, or that there perhaps
also exist olfactory or musical metaphors. The problem is that the verbal
metaphor itself often elicits references to visual, aural , tactile, and olfactory experiences.
And, finally, we must ask whether the metaphor is an expressive
mode with cognitive value. As an ornament, the metaphor is of no interest
to us, because, if it says more pleasantly that which can be said otherwise, then it could be explained wholly within the scope of a semantics
of denotation. We are interested in the metaphor as an additive, not
substitutive, instrument of knowledge.
Nevertheless, seeing the metaphor as a cognitive tool does not mean
studying it in terms of truth values. For this reason , d iscussions on the
aletic logic of metaphor (that is, whether a metaphor is truthful and
whether it is possible to draw true inferences from a metaphorical utterance) are not sufficient. It is obvious that · when someone creates
metaphors , he is, literally speaking, lying- as everybody knows. But
someone who utters metaphors does not speak 'literally' : he pretends to
make assertions, and yet wants to assert seriously something that is
beyond literal truth. How may one 'signal' such an ambiguous intention?
While it may be possible, then , to bypass an extensional semantics of
metaphor, it is impossible to avoid a pragmatics. From the point of view
of conversational maxims (Grice 1 967), the making of metaphors is a way
of flouting the maxim of Quality ( "Make your contribution one that is
true"), that of Quantity ( "Make your contribution to the conversation as
informative as possible"), that of Manner ("Avoid obscurity and ambigui ty" ), and that of Relation ( "Be relevant"). Someone u ttering
metaphors apparently lies, speaks obscurely, above all speaks of something other, all the while furnishing only vague information. And thus, if
somebody who is speaking violates all these maxims, and does so in such
a way as to not be suspected of stupidity or awkward ness, an implicature
must click in the listener's mind. Evidently, that speaker meant something else. The question that we want to discuss here is, if we want to
avoid any appeal to ineffable intuition, on what encyclopedic rules must
the solution of the metaphorical i mplicature base itself?
3.2. Traditional definitions
Current d ictionaries are usually u neasy about defining the metaphor:
"the transfer of the name of one object to another object through a relation of analogy" (but what is a relation of analogy in itself if not a
metaphorical relation?); " the substitution of an appropriate term with 
[90] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
one that is figurative" (quo species of the genus of figu res, the metaphor
is defined by a synecdoche); "an abbreviated simile .... "These all fall
into the classical definitions (cf. Lausberg 1 960); and even in the best of
cases, there are typologies of the various kinds of substitution, from
animate to inanimate, from inanimate to animate, from animate to animate, and from inanimate to inanimate, either in a physical or moral
sense; or otherwise there are substitutions of names, adjectives, verbs,
adverbs (cf. Brooke-Rose 1 958).
As far as synecdoche is concerned , it is spoken of as a "substitution of
two terms for each other according to a relation of greater or lesser extension" (part for the whole, whole for the part, species for genus, singular for plural , or vice versa), whereas metonymy is spoken of as a "substitution of two terms for each other according to a relation of contiguity"
(where contiguity is a rather fuzzy concept insofar as it covers the relations of cause/effect, container/content, instru ment for operation, place
of origin for original object, emblem for object emblematized , and so
on). And when it is specified that the synecdoche carries out a substitution within the conceptual content of a term, while metonymy acts outside
of that content, it is hard to see why the part for the whole is a synecdoche and the material for the object a metonymy - as though it were
'conceptually' essential for an object to have constituent parts and not to
be made of some material.
As will be seen in J . II. 2, this confusion is due to an 'archaeological'
and extrarhetorical reason. It will also be shown that the synecdoche
could be limited to semantic representations in the form of a dictionary,
reserving metonymy for representations in the form of an encyclopedia.
But in effect the dictionaries' embarrassment is the same as that of the
classical manuals, which constructed a typology of rhetorical figures (still
useful today for various aspects} that is quite admirable but riddled with
ambiguities: (a) it considers tropes as operations on single words (in verbis singulis }, precluding thus their contextual analysis; (b) it introd uces,
as we said above, the distinction synecdoche/metonymy on the basis of
the unexamined category of conceptual content; (c) it does not d istinguish
between syntactic and semantic operations (asyndeton and zeugma, for
example, are two cases of figures of words by detraction, where the first
concerns pure syntactic distribution but where the second implies
semantic decisions); (d) above all, it defines metaphor as a trope characterized by a dislocation or leap, where /dislocation/ and /leap/ are
themselves metaphors for « metaphor, , and where /metaphor/ is in its
tu rn a metaphor, insofar as it means (etymological ly) «transfer•• or
« displacement••.
Because the tradition has left several disconnected notions, we shall
have to look for a theory of metaphor in the moment when it is proposed
for the first time, that is, when it is proposed by Aristotle. 
Metaphor [91]
3·3· Aristotle: synecdoche and Porphyrian tree
Aristotle firs t confronts the issue of metaphor in the Poetics (1457-
bi - 1458a 1 7). In order to enliven language, it is possible to use, beside
common words, also foreign words, artificial coinages, lengthened ,
shortened , or altered expressions (in the Rhetoric many of these verbal
games, actual puns, will be analyzed), and , fi nally, metaphors. The
metaphor is defined as the recourse to a name of another type, or as the
transferring to one object of a name belonging to another, an operation
that can take place through displacements from genus to species, from
species to genus, from species to species, or by analogy.
Clearly, in laying the basis for a metaphorology , Aristotle uses metaphor
as a generic term: his first two types of metaphors are in fact synecdoches.
But it is necessary to look carefully at his entire classification and at the
examples woven into the commentary if we are to find the origins of all
that in the following centuries has been said on the metaphor.
First type: from genus to species. Following the definition of Groupe
f.L (1970), this type will now be called a 'generalizing synecdoche in I' .
The example used by Aristotle is This ship of mine stands there, since
standing is the genus that contains among its species lying at anchor. An
example that is more obvious and more canonical would be the use of
/animal/ for « men», man being a species of the genus animal .
According to Categories (I a I - 1 2), two things are named 'synonymous'
when they are both named according to their common genus (so both a
man and an ox can be called animal). Therefore a metaphor of the first
type is a form of synonymy whose generation and interpretation depend
on a preexisting Porphyrian tree (see chapter two in this book). In both
cases (synonymy and metaphor of the first type), we are witnessing a sort
of 'poor' definition. A genus is not sufficient to define a species, and it
does not entail its underlying species. In other words, to accept /animal/
for « man» , one should rely on an invalid inference: ((p :::> q) • q) :::> p.
From a logical point of view, Aristotle's second type of metaphor seems
more acceptable, since it represents a correct case of modus ponens: ((p :::>
q) • p) :::> q. Unfortunately, a material implication can sound very unconvincing from the point of view of natural language . Thus the metaphor
of the second type (which is another synecdoche, the one that Groupe f.L
calls 'particularizing synecdoche in I') is a really unsatisfactory one. The
example provided by Aristotle is Indeed ten thousand noble things Odysseus
did, where /ten thousand/ stand for « many» , a genus of which it is allegedly a species. The clumsiness of Aristotle's example is self-evident.
In fact, /ten thousand/ is necessarily <<many>> only in a Porphyrian tree
that is based on a certain scale of quantity. One can well imagine another
scale oriented toward astronomic sizes, in which ten thousand , even a
hundred thousand , is a rather scarce quantity. 
[92] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
In other words, though it may seem more or less necessary for a man
to be mortal, it is not so necessary that ten thousand be a lot. This
notwithstanding, /ten thousand/ suggests « many» intuitively and with
an undeniably hyperbolic tone, whereas /men/ for « animal, is not intuitively perceived as an interesting figure of speech - both examples depend , however, on the same logical scheme. Probably, according to the
code of the Greek language in the fourth century B.C. , the expression
/ten thousand/ was already overcoded (as a ready-made syntagm) and was
used to designate a great quantity. In other words, Aristotle explains the
modes of interpretation of this synecdoche taking as already disambiguated the synecdoche itself- a new example of confusion between
the structure of language, or of the lexicon, and the structure of the
world. The surprising conclusion is that metaphors of the second type
(particularizing synecdoches in I) are logically correct but rhetorically
insipid, whereas metaphors of the first type (generalizing synecdoches in
I) are rhetorically acceptable but logically unjustifiable.
3.4. Aristotle: metaphors of three terms
As for the third type, the Aristotelian example is two-fold : Then he drew
off his life with the bronze and Then with the bronze cup he cut the water.
Another translation would have a bronze sword , in the second case, cutting the flow of blood, or life. These are, in any case, two examples of a
passage from species to species: /drawing off/ and /cutting/ are two
cases of the more general « taking away>> . This third type genuinely
seems to be a metaphor: it could be said right away that there is something 'similar' between drawing off and cutting, for which reason logical
structure and interpretive movement could be represented as in Figure
J . I, where the passage from a species to its genus and then from that
genus to a second species can take place from right to left or from left to
right, according to which of Aristotle's two examples one should want to
discuss.
Taking away
/�
cutting drawing off
FIGURE J . I
This third type so truly see� to be a metaphor that many of the later
theories work out of preference on examples of this type. Different
authors have represented this third kind of metaphor using the following
diagram, where x and y a re respectively the metaphorizi ng and
metaphorized terms (Richards' vehicle and tenor) and where Z is the in-
Metaphor [93]
termediary term (the genus of reference) that permits the disambiguation as shown in Figure 3.2.
FIGURE 3.2
The diagram accounts for such expressions as the tooth of the mountain
(peak and tooth partake of the genus 'sharpened form') and she was a
birch (girl and birch partake of the genus 'flexible body'). Contemporary
theories say that birch acquires a 'human' property or that girl takes on a
'vegetal' property, and that, at any rate, the units in question lose some
of their own properties (see, for example, the theory of transfer features in
Weinreich 1972). But at this point, two problems arise.
First, to define which properties survive and which must d rop away,
we must by rights construct an ad hoc Porphyrian tree, and this operation
must be oriented by a universe of discourse or frame of reference (for
one of the first assertions of this principle, see Black 1955). Second, in
this operation of sememic intersection, a phenomenon arises that is new
with respect to synecdoches or metaphors of the first two types. Consider the twofold movement that is at the basis of both the production
and the interpretation of tooth of the mountain as shown in Figure 3.3.
Production Interpretation
Sharp Sharp
I \ I \
Peak Tooth Tooth Peak
FIGURE 3.3
In a synecdoche, in which a peak were named as something sharp,
peak would lose some of its characteristic properties (that of being mineral , for example) and share instead with the genus to which it is reduced some morphologic properties (in particular, that of being sharp).
In a metaphor of the third type, peak loses some properties in becoming
a sharp thing and regains others in becoming a tooth. While peak and
tooth, however, have in common the property of sharpness, their mutual
comparison also focuses on those very properties that stand in opposition.
This is so much the case that the phenomenon is referred to as a transfer
of properties, as mentioned above (peak becomes more human and organic, tooth acquires the property of being mineral). What makes
theories of 'transfer features' questionable is always the fact that we cannot tell who gains what and who loses instead something else. More than 
[94] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
of a transfer, we could speak of a 'back-and-forth' of properties. This
phenomenon is what in 3.6 will be called 'condensation' , as it was called
by Freud, and it is the phenomenon that characterizes the fourth type of
metaphor. At any rate, what likens the metaphor of the third type with
the fourth type is that mere identifications or absorptions (from species
to genus) are no longer the rules of the game: now it is both 'similarity'
and 'opposition' , or identity and difference, that are in question.
3·5· Aristotle: the proportional scheme
The metaphor by analogy or by proportion is a metaphor with four
terms, which are no longer AlB = C/B (for example, peak is to the
genus of sharp things in the same way as tooth), but A IB = C/D. The
cup is to Dionysus as the shield is to Ares, suggests Aristotle. In this
way, the shield can be defined as the cup of Ares or the cup as the shield of
Dionysus. And again: old age is to life as sunset is to day, and thus old
age can be defined as the sunset of life and the evening as day's old age.
Aristotle's definition has always seemed superb for its concision and
clarity. In fact, it is; and undoubtedly the idea of finding a sort of propositional function, in which infinite concrete instances can be inserted,
represented a stroke of genius. Even more so given that this proportional
formula permits the representation of even those cases of strict catachresis where the vehicle stands for a tenor that, lexically speaking, does
not exist: AlB = x/D. Aristotle provides his own, linguistically complex
example, but we can also turn to two familiar catachreses, the leg of the
table and the neck of the bottle. A leg is to a body as an unnamed object is to
the body of a table.
It becomes clear right away that the way leg is related to body is not
the same way in which neck is related to body. The leg of a table resembles a human leg provided we have a frame of reference that puts
into relief the property of 'support' , whereas the neck of a bottle is not
exactly the support of a cork nor, on the other hand , of the entire container. It seems that the analogy of leg plays on functional properties at
the expense of morphologic similarities ( themselves red uced to very
abstract equivalences, and quantity having been put aside as nonpertinent), while the analogy of neck drops the functionally pertinent features and insists on those that are morphological . Which is to say that,
yet again , different criteria for constructing a Porphyrian tree are in
question - if it were even still possible, though, to speak of Porphyrian
tree tout cou11. Consider the typical situation of a metaphor of the fourth
type, such as cup/Dionysus = shield/ Ares. How can we accommodate it
into any Porphyrian tree?
To begin with, the relation cup/Dionysus, according to the criteria of 
Metaphor [95]
the later theories of rhetoric, is of a metonymic type. Cup and Dionysus
are commonly associated by continguity, through the relation su bject/ instrument, through a cultural habit (without which cup could stand for
many other objects). This relation is not at all amenable to being expressed by a Porphyrian tree, unless we want to d raw broadly inclusive
equivalencies (of the following type: cup belongs to the class of things
characterizing Dionysus, or, alternatively, Dionysus belongs to the class
of all beings th at use cups). And the same goes for the relation
shield/ Ares. In other words, it is very difficult to recognize in this relation a case of embedding of genus within species.
The case of man/animal presents us with analytic properties, whereas
that of cup/Dionysus presents us with synthetic properties. Man is animal in virtue of its definition, whereas cup does not necessarily refer to
Dionysus, except in a very restricted co-textual situation in which the
various pagan gods are listed iconographically along with their characteristic attributes. Panofsky and Caravaggio would both hold that if
Dionysus then cup; but they themselves would agree that whereas it is not
possible to think of a man who is not an animal, it is always possible to
think of Dionysus without thinking of cup. Even if one should grant that
it is possible to group together the relations cup/Dionysus and man/
animal , a new problem surfaces: why should Dionysus be placed in a
relation with Ares and not, for example, with Ceres, Athena, or Vulcan?
While it is prudent to exclude the speaker' s intuition from this type of
consideration (since the speaker's intuition is determined by cultural
contexts}, it is to an extent intuitive that Aristotle himself would find it
difficult to name the spear of Athena as the cup of Athena and the
wheaten sheaves of Ceres as the shield of Ceres (even if baroque contexts where that is possi ble are not excluded). Intuition says that shield
and cup can entertain a relation because both are round and concave
(round and concave in different ways, yes, but therein is the metaphor's
cleverness, in making us see a certain resemblance between different
things). But what matches Dionysus and Ares? In the pantheon of pagan
gods, it is their d iversity that unites them (strange oxymoron). Dionysus
the god of joy and of the peaceful rites, Ares the god of death and war: a
play of similarities, then, mingling with dissimilarities. Cup and shield
become similar because of their roundness, d issimilar because of their
functions; Ares and Dionysus are similar because both are gods, dissimilar because of their respective domains of action.
Before this nexus of problems, a few observations immediately arise.
What was not clear and evident to Aristotle was thereafter developed at
different stages of later metaphorology. 
[96] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
3.6. Proportion and condensation
The metaphor with four terms does not set into play verbal substances
alone. No sooner has the proportion been established than it is possible
to see, as something incongruous, Dionysus actually drinking out of a
shield or Ares defending himself with a cup. In the first two types of
metaphor, the metaphorizing term absorbes (or confuses itself with) the
metaphorized term, much as a figure enters a multitude - or leaves
it - without our cognitive habits coming into question. At best, the result is something impoverished, both conceptually and perceptually. In
the third type of metaphor, instead , a superimposition of plant and girl is
created that is almost visual , as in the fourth type.
Albeit confusedly, Aristotle realizes that, by naming one thing with
something else's name, one denies the first thing those qualities proper
to it. Ares' shield could also be called cup without wine (Poetics 1457b32).
Henry (1971) notes that this is no longer a metaphor, but instead a "secondary phenomenon," as a consequence of the preliminary metaphor.
That is true, but it means that, as the metaphor starts to be understood,
the shield becomes a cup, even as this cup, while remaining round and
concave (though in a different way from the shield), loses the property of
being full of wine. Or, in reverse, one forms an image wherein Ares
possesses a shield that acquires the property of brimming with wine. In
other words, two images are conflated, two things become different from
themselves, and yet remain recognizable, and there is born a visual (as
well conceptual) hybrid.
Could it not be said that we have before us a kind of oneiric image?
The effect of such a proportion having been established is quite like
what Freud ( 1 889) called "condensation": where noncoincident traits
can be dropped while those in common are reinforced. The process is
typical not only of dreams but also of jokes (Witzen ), that is, of those
puns or compound words (1/Jvxpa) (Rhetoric 1 406b 1) or, even better, of
those witticismg ('a<TTEia) (ibid., 141 0b6) which seem so similar to some
of the categories of Witze, Kalauer, and Klangwitze analyzed by Freud
(1905 ). If the Freudian typology can be compared to a typology of
rhetoric, there can be no doubt that, at least, the final result of the
Aristotelian proportion is a process very much like Freudian condensation, and that this condensation, as will be better demonstrated later,
can be described as far its semiotic mechanism is concerned in terms of
the acquiring and losing of properties or semes, however we should wish to
call them. 
Metaphor [97]
3. 7. Dictionary and encyclopedia
According to what has been said in chapter two of this book, clearly the
properties set into motion by the third and fourth types of metaphor do
not have the same logical status as those set in motion by the first two
types. To obtain the condensation cup/shield, it is necessary to activate
properties or semes such as 'round' and 'concave' , 'war' and 'peace' ,
'life' and 'death'. It is clear here that a difference is being outlined between a semantic description in the form of a dictionary and a description in the form of an encyclopedia, or even, with inconsistent variations, between I properties and II properties (Groupe p. 1 970), between
semantic properties and semiological properties (Greimas 1 966), or between dictionary markers and world knowledge.
Groupe p. distinguishes between an 'endocentric' series of semes or
'conceptual' properties ( mode I) and an 'exocentric' series of parts or
'empirical' properties (mode II). An example of an endocentric series
would be the entailment oak- tree - plant (curiously, the authors consider only one d irection - "If x is a tree, then it is either a poplar or an
oak or a birch" - without considering that, if x is a poplar, then it is
necessarily a plant; but the two directions are obviously complementary).
An example of an exocentric series would be the relation between a tree
and its parts: trunk and branches and leaves. The distinction between
the two modes could be represented as in Figure 3.4.

FIGURE 3·4
Groupe IL knows very well that "these endoseries [that is, endocentric
series] exist in posse in the vocabulary; but it is we who trace their existence there, for each word or concept can, in principle, be the crossing
point of as many series as it contains semes" (1970; E ng. tr. , p. 1 00).
But after having shown this critical awareness of a dictionary's metalinguistic mechanisms, G roupe p. does not d raw from that the consequences it should, and falls into a sort of Aristotelian identification of
categories with things. Consider the way in which the various metaphorical constructions are explained by means of a double synecdochic exchange, from a generalizing synecdoche (Sg) to a particularizing synecdoche (Sp), and vice versa, whether in the I mode or the II mode. 
[98] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
The rule proposed is that the term /, which remains absent from the
metaphorical interpretation, must be a synecdoche of the term of origin
D, while the term of arrival A must be a synecdoche of I. The condition
is that A and D must be on the same level of generality. According to
mode I , the resulting metaphor will be based on semes common to D
and A, while in mode II it will base itself on their common parts. The
material part must be s maller than the whole, while the semic part must
be more general. (See Figure 3.5.)

FIGURE 3.5
Example (a) is incorrect. That a birch is flexible is a II property, unless one should change the dictionary tree and consider the genus of all
flexible things (of which obviously birches are one among the species). If
we look again carefully at the preceding scheme, a ( more) acceptable
example would be /poplar of the desert/ for « palm tree» (from palm to
tree and from tree to poplar).
Example (b) is correct, because one cannot say /he shook my head/ in
place of « he shook my hand». But the mechanism it exemplifies is not at
all impossible. The oneiric situation (or an instance of Witz) in which a
nose represents the penis (both being parts of a human body) is not at all
unthinkable. Why should nose be able to metaphorize penis, and hand
not be able to metaphorize head? The answer is suggested at various
moments by Greimas (1966): two semes can be opposed or joined according to their 'classeme' (which is nothing other than a 'contextual
selection' ; cf. Eco 1 976, 1 979). Nose and penis have in common the
characteristics of being 'appendages' and of being 'long' (besides the fact
that both are canals, both are pointed, and so on). A head instead has
semes of 'roundness' , 'apicality' , and 'oneness' , which a hand does not 
Metaphor [99]
h a v e . The subs tituti on, the n, is not based only on a play of
synecdoches - it puts into question a semic relation that is far more
complex, where the com mon reference of both nose and penis to human
body is contextually irrelevant. Only in this way does the effect of
superimposition that is typical of the processes of condensation take
place.
As regards example (c), again it seems that Groupe p. has chosen as
dictionary (or I) properties those that seem more appropriately II
properties - without making clear the contextual reasons that make it
necessary to assume them as dictionary properties in the first place. It is
true, though, that the metaphor in (c) appears impossible inasmuch as it
passes from a genus to a species, proceeding then from that species to
another genus that has nothing in common, however, with the first. According to Group p. such would be the case where there were a passage
from the genus 'iron' to the species 'blade' and then from the species
'blade' to the genus 'flat object' . The coexistence in one same object of
ferrous and flat qualities would not produce an intersection of properties.
Finally, we come to case (d). Groupe p.'s example is acceptable. One
can also think of the passage from crude oil to 'precious' (a II property of
crude oil): from the property 'precious' one ascends to another lexeme to
which the same marker could be ascribed , for example, gold, and there
would follow the substitution gold/oil in a metaphor such as /the gold of
the sheikhs/ or /black gold/ for «Oih>. But, even in this case, other
properties would come into question, such as 'black' or 'of the sheikhs' ,
which Groupe p.'s scheme does not take into consideration. These are all
problems that we will try to resolve further on.
At the close of this discussion of the Aristotelian proposal, we can say
that two clusters of problems have been brought into relief: (I) the
existence of processes of condensation, which the proportional relation is
hard put to explain; and (2) the need for a more flexible consideration of
the relations between dictionary properties and e ncyclopedic properties,
which can only be distinguished according to contextual exigencies. Why
then has Aristotle's proposal held myriad interpre ters in fasci nation
through the centuries? Two facts have played a role in the matter, that
is, responsibility lies with a misunderstanding, on the one hand , and an
extremely lucid i nsight, on the other.
J.8. The cognitive function
That misunderstanding or ambiquity arises when Aristotle, in passing
from his consideration of the first three types of metaphor to the fourth
type, changes his game without even being aware of it: in speaking of the
first three types, he explains how a metaphor is produced and u nder-
[100] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
stood, whereas in speaki ng of the fou rth type he explains what a
metaphor enables us to know. In the first three cases, he says how the
metaphorical production and interpretation function (and that he can do
because the mechanism, which is synecdochic, is rather simple and is
based on the inflexible logic of a Porphyrian tree, however that tree is
selected). In the fourth case, Aristotle tells what the metaphor says, or in
what way it increases our knowledge of the relations between things ­
though he explains it only partly. The metaphor cup of .Ares certainly
raises the suspicion that some indeterminate relation exists between cup
and shield, and between Ares and Dionysus. But the theory of condensation explains that what we learn is not j ust that. The Aristotelian proportion is an empty schema where infinite pieces of encyclopedic information can be inserted; but what a metaphor allows us to know has more
to do with those inserted items of knowledge than with the schematic
relation that is filled up. The later periods of the metaphorological tradition hold up the theory of the proportion or analogy as an explanation of
the metaphor's mechanisms - at the cost of a self-debasing chain of
tau tologies (for example, "a metaphor is that thing that permits us to
have knowledge that is analogical, in other words, metaphorical" ) - and
frequently ignore the most ingenious and vigorous of Aristotle's conclusions, that the metaphor is not only a means of delight but also, and
above all, a tool of cognition (as Freud, moreover, was able to show with
regard to Witze).
When reading the Aristotelian texts (the Poetics and the Rhetoric), one
is struck by the fact that examples of metaphor that are not convincing
often appear, where the translator-philologist himself admits to not being
able to grasp the obviousness of a proportion assumed as self-evident.
One often has the same response, moreover, when confronting texts
from distant cultures. Consider, for example, the Song of Songs: "I have
compared thee , 0 my love, to a company of horses ... " (Song 1:9);
"Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing" (ibid. ,
4:2); "Her legs are as pillars of marble ... " (ibid. , 5 : 15); "Thy nose is as
the tower of Lebanon ... " (ibid. , 7:4). Notice that these are similes and
therefore give the proportion in advance rather than suggest it in the
form of an enigma. If a metaphor were only the contraction of an already
posited proportion - so that, from the perspective of production, one
starts from the simile and, interpretively speaking, one arrives at it - a
simile would always be convincing. And yet it cannot be denied that one
is led to see sheep coming out of the water as shaggy, dripping creatures
(bleating and smelly, as well): a terrible premise on which to build an
analogy on the "black but comely" maiden whose "two breasts are like
two young does that are twins" (ibid., 7: 3).
Nevertheless, we can imagine how the biblical poet d rops all those 
Metaphor [101]
properties of sheep negatively identified above , so as to preserve only
the characteristic of their aequa/itas numerosa, their splendid unity in
variety - as well as their whiteness. It is understood that the poet is able
to do so because within his culture these most probably were the properties associated with sheep, at least within the poetic tradition. And it is
also clear that, the qualities chosen to define the beauty of a healthy and
sturdy country girl, destined to tend the flocks among the rocky Palestinian hills, single out her upright solidity (like that of columns), her unbroken state of perfection, in the same way that it is not so much the
cylindrical shape of columns that is preeminently chosen as is their
whiteness, instead, and their grace of line.
But, to reach these conclusions, one must undertake an impassioned
'hermeneutic circle' ; one assumes a code, which is verified against the
simile, whose metaphorical transformations are appraised in advance; or
one starts from the simile in order to infer a code that makes it acceptable; one starts to become familiar, at one and the same time, with both
the biblical poet' s aesthetic worldview and the maiden's properties; in
other words, one learns something extra about the maiden and about the
intertextual universe of the biblical poet, simultaneously. Analyzing
further this process of trial and error, we would realize that we are dealing with multiple inferential movements: hypothesis (or abduction), induction, and ded uction. The same process takes place when we understand a catachresis - not the institutionalized catachresis, transformed
into a codified lexeme (for example, the leg of a table), but the institutive catachresis, which later will be identified by many as the 'auroral'
moment of language. Inflationary spiral is an institutive catachresis (language creates metaphors even outside of poetry, simply out of a need to
find names for things). And if institutive catachreses require interpretive
labor, it is because the latent proportion (which could be expressed in a
simile) does not exist before the metaphor; it must be found, whether by
the person who invents the catachresis or by the person interpreting it
(at least, for a brief stretch of the trope's circulation), after which discovery language absorbs the trope, lexicalizes it, and registers it as an
overcoded expression.
This is precisely what Aristotle meant to say when he assigned a
cognitive function to the metaphor - not only when he associates
metaphor with enigma, an extended sequence of metaphors, but also
when he says that creating metaphors "is a sign of a natural disposition
of the mind ," because knowing how to find good metaphors means perceiving or grasping the similarity of things between each other (To OIJ.Otov
t'Jewpe"iv) (Poetics 1 45986 - 8). But if the proportion between cup and
shield and between Ares and Dionysus were already overcoded , that
metaphor would not say anything other than what is already known. If it 
[ 1 02] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
says something new, it means that either (a) the proportion was not so
commonly accepted, or (b) if it was accepted it was then soon forgotten.
And thus the metaphor posits ('posits' in a philosophical sense, but also
in a physical sense, as "in putting before the eyes' , 70 7Tp0 OJJ-JJ-aTWV'Y}OLBiV a
proportion that, wherever it may have been deposited, was not before
the eyes; or it was before the eyes and the eyes did not see it, as with
Poe's purloined letter.
To point out, or teach how to see, then. To see what? The likeness
between things, or the subtle network of proportions between cultural
units (that is, the fact that sheep are indeed unique and equal in their
variety or the fact that a certain culture sees a flock of sheep as an
example of unity within variety)? To this question Aristotle gives no answer, as was only appropriate for one who had iden tified the modes of
being of Being (the categories) with the modes of being of language.
What Aristotle understood was that the metaphor is not an ornament
(Koup,o<;), but rather a cognitive instrument, at once a source of clarity
and enigma:
Accordi ngly, it is metaphor that is in the highest degree instructive [ ... ]. It
follows, then, for style and reasoning [enthymenes] alike, that in order to be
lively [lively expressions are the &a-rEia, which in the Baroque period will
be the metaphorical witticisms] they must give us rapid information. Consequently, we arc not highly grarified by en thy memes that arc obvious - and
"obvious" means absolutely plain to everyone, not demanding a bit of mental inquiry - nor by those which , when stated, we do not understand. What
we like are those that convey informarion as fast as they are stated - so long
as we did not have the knowledge in advance - or that our minds lag only a
little behind. With the latter two kinds there is some process of learning.
(Rhetoric I40ibi4- 25; E ng. tr. , p. 207)
Aristotle provides the most luminous confirmation of the metaphor's
cognitive function when he associates it with mimesis. Ricoeur ( 1 975)
warns that if metaphor is mimesis it cannot be an empty, gratuitous game.
In the Rhetoric ( 1 4 I I b25fj) the re is no roo m for doubt: the best
metaphors are those that "show things in a state of activity ." Thus
metaphorical knowledge is knowledge of the dynamics of the real. That
defi nition seems rather restrictive , but it can be reformulated as follows:
the best metaphors are those in which the cultural process, the dynamics
itself of semiosis, shows through. Aristotle defeats right from the start
the theorists of the easy metaphor, whether they are the classical
moralists, who feared the metaphor's cosmetic and deceitful nature, or
the Baroque immoralists, who privileged its 'spicy' nature, or, finally,
the current semanticists who see rhetorical ornatus, at the most, as a
structure even more superficial than surface structu re, incapable of tap-
Metaphor [103]
ping deep structures, whether these are syntactic, semantic, or logical .
To all of these theorists Aristotle had already said , "Metaphors . . .
should be drawn from objects that are related to the object in question,
but not obviously related; in rhetoric as in philosophy the adept will
perce ive resemblances even in things that a re fa r apa rt" (ibid.,
141 2a 1 1 - 12; Eng. tr. , p.212).
And that these likenesses were not only in things but also (perhaps
above all) in the ways in which language defines things, the philosopher
knew well when he lamented (ibid . , 1 405a25 - 27) how pirates in his
time had the gall to call themselves purveyors, and how wily the orator is
in a calling crime an error or an error a crime. All that pirates had to do,
it seems, was fi nd a genus that fitted their species and adapt to the
purpose a creditable Porphyrian tree; it is true that they transport merchandise by sea, as do commercial purveyors. What is manipulatory of
reality, or ideological, is to select only that one out of all the other properties that were characteristic of pirates, and through that choice make
themselves known, put themselves before others' eyes in this perspective
and under that particular description.
3·9· The semiosic background: the system of content
3·9·1. The medieval encyclopedia and analogia entis
We have seen how Aristotle's limitation consists in his identifying the
categories of language with the categories of being. This identification is
not questioned by post-Aristotelian rhetoric - from the Rhetorico ad
Herennium, through Cicero and Quintilian, all the way to the medieval
gra m marians and rhetoric ians. In the meanti me , the traditional
classification of figures has been worked out in this period . However, a
panmetaphorical attitude, established in the Middle Ages, deserves a
brief discussion, since it helps resolve (even if in a negative manner) the
question with which we are concerned.
Saint Paul had already affirmed that "we see through a glass, darkly"
(I Corinthians 13: 1 2). Medieval Neoplatonism gives a metaphysical
frame to this hermeneutic tendency. In a universe that is nothing other
than an emanative outpouring from the unknowable and unnameable
One down to the furthest ramifications of matter, every being functions
as a synecdoche or metonymy of the One. When Hugh of Saint Victor
affirms that the "entire sensible world is, so to speak, a book written by
the hand of God ," and that "all visible things, visibly presented to us by
a symbolic instruction, that is, figured, are proposed for the declaring
and signifying of things invisible" (Didascalicon, PL, CLXXVI, col . 8 14),
he gives us to understand that there exists a sort of code that, assigning
to things emergent properties, allows them to become metaphors for 
[104] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
supernatural things, in accordance with the traditional theory of the four
levels of exegesis (the literal, allegorical, moral, and analogical). 'fhis is
the project taken up in bestiaries, the lopidorio, the imagines mundi, all
formed on the Hellenistic model of the Physiologus: certain properties are
predicated of every animal, plant, part of the world, or event in nature,
and, on the basis of an identity between one of these properties and one
of the properties of the supernatural being that is to be metaphorized, a
correlation is established . There exists a network of cultural i nformation,
which functions as a cosmological code.
The code is ambiguous, nevertheless, since of all the properties there
are to choose from it chooses only a few, and those are contradictory.
The lion erases his tracks with his tail to throw the hunters off his track
and is thus a figure of Christ canceling the traces of sin; but in Psalm 21
the terrible maw of the beast- "Salvo me de ore leonis" - becomes a
metaphor of Hell, and ''per leonem ontichristum intelligitur" definitively.
Even though medieval Neoplatonism was not aware of it (but the
medieval rationalists, from Abelard to Ockham, would not fail to realize
this), the universe, which seems to be a rhizomotic or mazelike network
of real properties, is in effect a mazelike network of cultural properties,
and those properties are attributed both to the earthly beings and to the
heavenly beings in order that metaphorical substitutions may be possible.
What medieval Neoplatonists knew was that, in order to decide
whether the lion must be seen as a figuro Christi or as a figure of the
Antichrist, a co-text is necessary. The tradition provides a typology of
possible co-texts, so that the best interpretation is always the one recorded by some (intertextual) ouctoritos. That the question is merely one
of cultural networks, and not of ontological realities, Thomas Aquinas
was well aware , and he disposes of the problem in two ways. On the one
hand , he admits that there is only one portion of reality in which things
and events themselves acquire metaphorical and allegorical value, inasmuch as they have been created and disposed thus by God himself:
sacred hist?ry, and for this reason the Bible in itself is literal (it is the
things of which it speaks literally that are figures). There remains as well
the figure of the parable, as it is used in poetry (but in this sense one
need not leave the bounds of classical rhetoric). But, on the other hand ,
insofar as it is necessary to speak of God in accordance with the dictates
of reason, and given that God is at an immense distance from the created
world, with which He is not in a Neoplatonic identity, but which He
keeps alive through an act of participation, Aquinas turns to the principle
of the onologio entis. Inasmuch as God's perfection transcends that of His
creations, it is impossible to speak of Him univocally, nor can one limit
oneself to speaking of Him equivocally; He must be spoken of, then, 
Metaphor [l OS]
through analogy or, in other words, by means of a proportion between
cause and effect. Through a kind of metonymy, therefore, which is held
up, however, by a proportion of metaphorical type.
What is the foundation of the analogy? Is this a case of a logicallinguistic artifice, or of an actual ontological network? The interpreters
are discordant. Among the modern exegetes, Gilson admits that "what
Saint Thomas calls our knowledge of God consists in our aptitude for
forming affirmative propositions about Him" (1947: 1 57). We only have
to push a bit further to affirm, with no threat to Thomist orthodoxy, that
the analogy speaks only of the knowledge men have of reality, of their
way of naming concepts , and not of reality itself. The metaphor derived
from that knowledge is a suppositio impropria based on a proportion between intentiones secundae, where, in other words, the expression /dog/
(whether verbal or visual) does not mean the real dog, but rather the
word dog or the concept of «dog•• (Mcinerny 1 961). In a universe comprehensible by means of the proportion between God and things, the
fundamental mechanism is actually found in an identity between names,
even if for Thomas (unlike the nominalists) those names reflect the
properties of things.
3·9·2· Tesauro's categorical index
An interesting return to the Stagyrite's model is found in the Cannocchiale
aristotelico (The Aristotelian Binocular) of Emanuele Tesauro (1655), written at the very height of the Baroque period. From Aristotle, Tesauro
inherits the tendency to call every trope and figure a metaphor. I shall
not speak here of the detail and enthusiasm with which the author of the
treatise studies puns both in single words and in actual microtexts, and
of how he extends the metaphorical mechanism to visual puns, painting,
sculpture, actions, inscriptions, proverbs, truncated phrases, laconic
messages, mysterious characters, hierograms, logogriphs, cryptograms,
gestures, medallions, columns, ships, garters, chimeric bodies. I shall
not s peak of those sections in which Tesauro borders on modern
speech-acts theory, showing how language states, narrates, affirms, denies, swears, corrects, holds back, exclaims, doubts, approves, admonishes, orders, praises, derides, invokes, questions, thanks, vows,
and so on. (With regard to all these aspects and to the others of which I
will speak, I direct the reader to Speciale's reconstruction, 1 978. )
Tesauro knows that metaphors are not created out of a pure joy of inven tion, but that they i mpose on one a labor, to master which takes
practice .
The first exercise is the reading of catalogues, anthologies, hieroglyphic collections, medallions (and their reverse sides), emblems - in a
way, a pure invitation to intertextuality, to the imitation of the 'already 
[1 06] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
said' . B ut the second stage of the exercise presupposes learning a
combinatory mechanism.
Tesauro invites his reader to draft a categorical index, that is, a model of
an organized semantic universe. Such a model begins with Aristotle's
categories (Substance, Quantity, Quality, Relation, Place, Time, Position, Possession, Activity, Passivity; see Categories 1 b25 - 2a8) and then
organizes under each of these categories the various members that are
inclusive of everything susceptible to such categorization. Suppose we
have to make a metaphor on a dwarf. We leaf through the categorical
index until we find the entry Quantity; we then identify the concept
'little things' , and all such microscopic things as may be found under
that rubric may be divided still further according to contextual selections
(as we would say now): astronomy, human organism, animal, plant, and
so on. But an index organized by substances would have to be integrated
with a second index in which each substance were analyzed according to
the particles that define how the object in question manifests itself. ( For
example, under the category of Quantity we would then have to find
what measurements it has, what weight it has, how many parts it has;
and under Quality there would be the specificiations whether it is visible, whether it is hot, and so on.) As can be seen, this is essentially a
system of content organized as an encyclopedia. At this point, we will
fi nd that the smallest measure is the Geometric Thumb, and we will say
that in order to measure a dwarf's body, a geometric thumb would be
too gross a measure.
While he is a careless structuralist, Tesauro knows nevertheless that it
is no longer ontological relations but the structure itself of language that
guarantees the metaphorical transfers. Look, for example, at the Aristotelian metaphor of old age as the sunset of life (or of youth as spring).
Tesauro still proceeds by analogy, but the relation is one of contiguity in
t!te index. The transfer is structured as in Figure 3.6.
Analogous genus . . . . . . . . . . . . �
Duration of time
Subordinate genus . .... Human age Season of the year
+ +
Analogous species . . . . . . . Youth Spring
FIGURE 3.6
The higher nodes become classemes or contextual selections of the
lower nodes. One can see that the analogy Aristotle perceived between
draw off and cut functions when the act of drawing off is considered
under the category of Passivity; but, if it is considered under the category of Possession, drawing off becomes analogous to other processes of
acquisition and not to processes of deprivation (take away). Henceforth, 
Metaphor [107]
there is the possibility of searching through the categorical index ad infinitum, and of uncovering a reserve of untapped metaphors, and of
metaphorical propositions and arguments.
Tesauro's model still represents the framework of medieval Ncoplatonism - which it has deliberately resolved, though, into a network of
units of purely cultural content. It is, however, announcing the model of
an unlimited semiosis. While being a still too hierarchical system of
semes, it produces a web of interpretants.
3·9·3· Vico and the cultural conditions of invention
An overview of the history of metaphorology and of its epistemic breaks,
however brief, must not leave out Vico, not least because of the fact that
La Scienza Nuova (and its chapter "Della logica poetica" ) seems to put
into question the existence of a cultural network, of semantic fields and
universes, and of a preestablished process of semiosis, which should precede (on the basis of the foregoing observations) the prod uction and interpretation of metaphors.
Certainly, Vico discusses the "first tropes," and the phenomenon of
speaking by means of animate substances, whereby natural objects and
phenomena are named by reference to parts of the body (1744; E ng. tr. ,
p. 1 29), for example, the eyes of needles, the lips of a vase, and so on.
Now, much too much has been said about this 'auroral' moment of language; in the view of some interpreters, Vico argues that the creating of
metaphors is an inborn ability in beings who are at the dawn or awakening of their own intelligence; metaphorical speech, furthermore, would
be iconic, insofar as it instituted a kind of native onomatopoeic relation
between words and things. But the fact is, Vico knows and says that,
outside the utopia of an Adamic language (an idea already in Dante and
later elaborated in seventeenth-century England, as well as in Vico's
own time), what is indisputable is the diversity of languages. In fact,
as the people have certainly by diversity of climates acquired different natures, from which have spru ng as many different customs, so from their
different natures and customs as many different languages have arisen. For
by virtue of the aforesaid diversity of their natures they have regarded the
same u tilities or necessi ties of hu man life from different points of view, and
there have thus arisen so many national customs, for the most part differing
from one another and at times contrary to one another; so and not otherwise
there have arisen as many different languages as there are nations. (Ibid., p.
1 48)
Given which, evidently, Vico makes the following fundamental observations: languages, like customs, are born as the response of groups of
human beings to the material environment in which they live; even if 
[1 08] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
the disposition toward language functions and develops in all human
societies according to the same logic, and even if the utilities and necessities of life are the same for everybody, nevertheless, human societies
have looked at these material universals from diff erent viewpoints, which is
to say, they have made pertinent diff erent aspects of their universe.
Catachreses are created out of transpositions of natural objects "according to their natural properties or sensible effects" (ibid., p. 1 47); in
this sense the labor of metaphor is always motivated. What must be
asked here is if those effects and properties - given that metaphors are
the result of a selection of pertinent aspects - are not already cultural .
constructions. If metaphors require an underlying cultural framework,
then the hieroglyphic language of the gods cannot be a merely primitive
stage of human consciousness: it needs the presence of both the symbolic
language of heroes and the epistolary language of men as its starting
point. Thus Vico is not speaking of a linear development from a
metaphorical language to a more conventional language, but of a continual, cyclical activity.
The language of the gods is a heap of unrelated synecdoches and
metonymies: thirty thousand gods as identified by Varro, as many as the
Greeks counted, including stones, fountains, reefs, brooks, minute objects, signifiers of forces, causes, connections. The language of heroes
already creates metaphors (which thus are not so primeval), bu t the
metaphor or catachresis invents a new term using at least two terms that
are already known (and expressed) and presupposing at least another one
that is unexpressed. Could that symbolic language establish itself without the support of an epistolary language, the only language recognizedly
conventional? On this point Vico is very explicit:
To enter now upon the extremely difficult [question of the] way in which
these three kinds of languages and letters were formed, we must establish
this principle: that as gods, heroes, and men began at the same time (for
they were, after all, men who imagined the gods and believed their own
heroic nature to be a mixture of the divine and human natures), so these
three languages began at the same time, each having its letters, which
developed along with it. (Ibid., p. 1 49)
In light of these considerations, Vico's semiotic resembles, more than
an aesthetics of ineffable creativity, a cultural anthropology that recognizes the categorical indices on which metaphors are based, indices
whose historical conditions, birth, and variety it researches even as it
explores the variety of brave deeds, of medallions, and of fables. 
Metaphor [109]
J.Io. The limits of formalization
At this point we cannot ignore the fact that formal semantics, in the
effort to transform itself into a logic of natural languages, has recently
made several important s trides toward red ucing the scandal of the
metaphor; that is, formal semantics has sought to expand a logic of truth
conditions so as to recognize the legiti macy of meta p horical
expressions - expressions that speak about the world by lying. What we
want to suggest here is that, at most, a formal semantics can define the
place that a metaphorical calculus might occupy within its framework ­
yet again, it does not explain what it means to understand a metaphor.
Take one conjecture, among the many, which is perhaps the most
recent of the efforts to formalize the phenomenon. The model put forth
is intended "to reflect the context-sensitivity of the metaphor, and to
give a metaphorical interpretation to stat�ments which may be literally
true and nondeviant" (Bergmann 1 979: 225). A vocabulary is proposed
that is outfitted with monadic predicates P11 P2, with a dyadic predicate
= , with individual constants a1, a2, with individual variables v11 v2, and
with normal logical connectives. Grammatical rules are provided (of the
type if t1 1 t2 are terms, then t1 = t2 is a formula), and a class of "ideal
contexts" C is added to the semantics of this language L.
Let D be a non-empty class; it is the domain of discourse and is assumed to
be comprised of possible (acmal and non-actual) individuals. An in terpretation function assigns to every monadic predicate of L a subset of D, and to
every constant an element of D. Let F be the class of all i nterpretation
functions on D. Choose some element of F as the literal interpretation
function - it assigns to the monadic predicates and constants of the language their literal interpretations. Call this function '.f". Let F" be the class
of all interpretation functions f in F which agree with f' in the val ues assigned to the constants. Let g be the metaphorical disambiguating function :
it assigns to every c e C a member of F" - (/''). The idea here is that g tells
us, for each ideal context, what the metaphorical interpretations of predicates in that context are. Finally, let a model for L be the 5-tuple M =
(D,C, f', F", g). (Ibid., p. 226)
Obviously, this defintion does not say anything about metaphors. In
effect, it does not at all pretend to say anything: the author is not interested in understanding how metaphors function, but, rather (once it has
been intuitively accepted that in natural languages metaphors are easily
produced and understood), she is interested in introducing this phenomenon into the formal representation of a natural language. True, the
author herself warns that, at least, the model she proposes permits her
better to consider certain questions and to formulate such in a manner 
[ 1 1 0] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
that is formally acceptable. For example, what must be understood by
literal paraphrasability; whether metaphorical interpretations depend on
those that are literal, and whether every linguistic expression is interpretable metaphorically in some context, or in every context, and so on.
But these are questions the answers to which are not given (at least for
the time being) by formal semantics: "without an ideal context there are
no strict rules for interpretation of metaphors" (ibid . , p. 228) - which is
what metaphorology already knew; it is important, however, that the
several formal semantics become aware of this.
There are formal approaches, of course, that by virtue of their taking
into consideration the contributions of linguistics, of lexicology, and of
semiotics in general allow their (tendential) preoccupations with concreteness to show through to a greater degree. In the mean time, though,
it is to studies of this sort that the distinction is owed between what
could be called an 'intensional' metaphor and one that is 'extensional' .
An example of the first type is The girl is a birch, which, given certain
meaning postulates (for example, if young girl then human; if reed then
nonhuman ), clearly mainfests its metaphoricity (otherwise it would be a
semantically incorrect expression, or an outright lie). An example of the
second type is the emperor entered, an expression which in itself is literal
and, semantically speaking, unambiguous, unless it should refer in a
particular circumstance to the en trance of an office manage r. This
example would occur only in an absurd universe in which metaphors
appeared only in expressions isolated from their context, and where only
one semantic system were engaged, that of verbal language; that is, such
a situation verifies itself only in books of linguistics and in books of
formal semantics. In fact, a sentence of that sort is usually uttered (a) in
a context in which it has already been said or will i mmediately be said
that the office manager is enteri ng, (b) while one is showing an image of
the office manager as he is entering, (c) while indicating a person whom
anyone recognizes as the office manager and, in any case, as someone
who is not an emperor. All of which means that, the isolated expression
having been put into contact with the linguistic context and the elements of extralinguistic systems, it would immediately be retranslated as
the office manager (who is) the emperor is entering (given that there is not a
question here of information de dicto: the office manager, whom we call
the emperor, is entering). At this point, the second example falls into
the category of the first: the girl is not a birch, j ust as the office manager
is not the emperor. (In any event, for all these cases of mentioning and
referring, see Eco 1976, 3 . 3).
Van Dijk admits that "only a fragment of a serious theory of metaphor
can be covered by the formal seman tics approach. A formal semantics
specifies the conditions under which metaphoric sentences may be said 
Metaphor [111]
to have a truth-value" (1975 : 1 73). And he makes clear that a formal
seman tics with such ambitions cannot but be 'sortal', that is to say, it
must be a semantics that accounts for "selection restrictions" (for example, if automobile includes the seme ' mechanical' or 'inorganic' and if to
eat includes semes such as 'human' and 'the object is inorganic' , then it
is semantically deviant to say Jolm ate the automobile; if to eat includes a
seme 'human' one will not be able to say The automobile ate up the rood,
that is, it will be necessary to admit that this sortal deviation has
metaphorical intentions). Hence the difference between expressions that
are sortally incorrect (such as The square root of Susy is happiness, whose
very negation is false) and which do not seem to have any possible
metaphorical interpretation (naturally that is not true; it depends on the
context), expressions that are sortally i ncorrect but with a possible
metaphorical interpretation (The sun smiled high up in the sky), and expressions that are sortally correct and that can, in particular situations of
referring, be metaphorical (The emperor is entering). A sortal specification
would then be a function that assigns to each predicate of the language a
"region of logical space ."
It seems that such a region, which a formal semantics identifies as an
abstract and 'empty' entity. once filled up cannot be anything other than
a portion of Tesau ro's categorical index. Given that this region would be
populated by 'points' , 'possible individ uals' , or 'possible objects' , the
problem of the metaphor would entail the question of the similarities
and differences between these objects. Right, but not enough. Naturally
the theory is not as dumb as it seems: within its framework it is possible
to give a formal definition, once d ifferences and similarities have been
granted, of the greater or lesser distance between the metaphorizing and
metaphorized terms. The horse growls is less daring a metaphor than The
theory of relativity growls, because in the play of related properties there is
undoubtedly more of a relation between a growl and the 'animal' property of a horse than there is between a growl and the 'abstract object'
property of the Einsteinian theory. But this useful definition of distance
is not capable of deciding which of the two metaphors is better. All the
more so, in view of the fact that at the end the author (who knows more
about metaphors than the method he chooses in his article allows him)
finishes by admitting that "the choice of typical criteria for the similarity
function is pragmatically determined on the basis of cultural knowledge
and beliefs" (ibid ., p. 191).
No greater satisfaction is given by another attempt at formalization, by
a logician who takes off right from Aristotle, Guenthner: "If metaphors
are to be analyzed within the framework of formal semantics, the first
thing will obviously be to provide for a way of implementing information
about the meaning structure of predicates which is relevant for their 
[1 1 2] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
metaphorical behavior" (1975 : 205). But immediately he says that it will
not be necessary, however, to construct this semantic information in the
form of an encylopedia, and a few sortal specifications will be enough.
Which is exactly the way to preclude an understanding of a trope. Such
is the case that, when he analyzes some examples borrowed from
Groupe fL, Guenthner rediscovers the same old relation of girl-birch.
And as we shall see, the fact that a girl and a birch tree are both flexible
is properly an item of encyclopedic information. At any rate, Guenthner' s model (useless for understanding how a metaphor functions) seems
more useful than the others for expanding a formal semantics of natural
languages. Its author starts, in fact, from a distinction between natural
kinds (fish, lion, and so on), opposing these against nonnatural kinds
(such as president), and plays on the fact that the properties of a natural
kind must be contextually selected (obviously on the basis of the context) in order to make the metaphor acceptable and comprehensible. A
sortal model is a 4-tuple M = (D, J, k, s ) , such that D is a nonempty
domain of objects, or a universe of discourse, f a function of interpretation, k a function that assigns to every object in D the kinds to w hich the
object belongs in the model, and s is a function drawn from the group of
those predicates not assigned as natural kinds by k. A sortal model determines which statements are true, false, or meaningless (that is, literally nonsignificant).
If we now add a function p which assigns to each predicate P in L a set of
'prominent' properties, a sortal model accounts for the metaphorical meaning of an expression in roughly the fol lowing way. If a sentence cp is neither
true nor false in M and if cp translates for example the English sentence:
John is a mule (cp = E x(x = j & Mx) or Mj) then cp can be interpreted
metaphorically if there is a 'prominent' property assigned to M such that
that property holds true of John. (Note that in our culture such properties
are usually rather well delimited, but never related to the basic meaning of
the expression - this can be easily tested in t ranslating metaphorical
sentences from one natural language into another. ) (Ibid., p. 217)
Because entities such as the prominent properties, and every other
possible insertion into the sortal apparatus, cannot be accounted for by a
formal semantics, the present inspection of this universe of discourse
must stop here. And we have to go back, as I said above, to a componential semantics.
3.1 1. Componential representation and pragmatics of the text
3.11.1. A model by 'cases'
We can ven tu re at this point an explanation of the metaphorical mechanism that (a) is founded on a componential semantics in the format of an 
Metaphor [ 1 1 3]
encyclopedia and that (b) takes into account, at the same time, rules for
contextual insertion. An encyclopedic semantics is undoubtedly more interesting than a dictionary. The format of a dictionary, we have seen,
permits us to understand the mechanism of the synecdoche, but not that
of the metaphor. We only have to look at the efforts made by transformational grammar and interpretive semantics approaches. (For a synthetic account, see Levin 1 977. ) Establishing that a 'transference' or
transfer of properties occurs in the sentence She is a birch, whereby a girl
would acquire the seme 'vegetal' or birch the seme 'human' , tells us
very little abou t what happens in the interpretation and production of
that trope. In fact, if we try to paraphrase the result ("This girl is human
but also has a vegetal property") we see that it is not very far from being
a parody of itself. The issue here is obviously one of flexibility (but,
again: a birch tree is not flexible in the same way that a young girl is
. .. ), and it cannot be considered within a semantics in the format of a
dictionary.
A componential representation in the format of an encyclopedia, however, is potentially infinite and assumes the form of Model Q (Eco
1976), that is to say, of a polydimensional network of properties, in
which some properties are the interpretants of others. In the absence of
such a network, none of these properties can attain the rank of being a
metalinguistic construction or a unit belonging to a privileged set of
semantic universals. In a model dominated by the concept of unlimited
semiosis, every sign (linguistic and non-) is defined by other signs (linguistic and non-), which in turn become terms to be defined by other
terms assumed as interpretants. With the advantage that an encyclopedic
representation (even if ideal), based on the principle of unlimited interpretation, is capable of explaining in purely semiotic terms the concept of 'similarity' between properties.
By similarity between two semes or semantic properties we mean the
fact that in a given system of content those properties are named by the
same interpretant, whether it be verbal or not, and independently of the
fact that the objects or things for the designation of which that interpretant is customarily used may manifest perceptual 'similarities' . In other
words, the teeth of the maiden in the Song of Solomon are like the sheep
if, and only if, in that given culture the interpretant white is used to
designate both the color of teeth and that of sheep's fleece.
But metaphors set up not only similarities but also oppositions. A cup
and a shield are alike in their form (rou nd and concave), but opposite in
their function (peace vs. war), j ust as Ares and Dionysus are alike insofar
as they are gods, but opposite with regard to the ends they pursue and to
the instruments they use. To acco unt fo r these phenomena, an
encyclopedic representation has to assume the form of a case grammar,
which should recognize therefore the Subject Agent, the Object on 
[1 14] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
whom the agent executes his action, the Counter Agent who may
possibly opposed himself to that action, the Instrument used by the
agent, the Goal of the action, and so on. A semantics of this type has
been elaborated by various authors (cf. Greimas' and Tesnicre's actants,
Fillmore's grammatical cases, Bierwisch's semantics, irrespective of their
substantial differences; see also Nef 1979).
As a first approach, let us say that the properties that a case-l ike representation associates with a given action display a metonymic character:
goal, instrument or agent seem to be metonymically linked to the represented action. We shall see later in which sense this kind of metonymic
relationship also accou nts for synecdochic relationships and ought to be
considered as the basis for every metaphoric substitution.
J.I I .z. Metonymy
From this perspective a metonymy becomes the substitution of a sememe with
one of its semes (for example, /Drink a bottle/ for cc drink wine••, because a
bottle will be registered among the fi nal destinations of wine) or of a
seme with the sememe to which it belongs (for example, /Weep thou , 0
jerusalem/ for << May the tribe of Israel weep» , because among the
encyclopedic properties of jerusalem must be included that of its being
the holy city of the jews).
This type of metonymic su bstitution is no different from the process
Freud called "displacement." And just as condensation is involved with
the process of displacement, so is metaphor involved (as we shall see)
with these metonymic exchanges. On the basis of a representation by
cases, I attempted to show (1976) the mechanism of displacement from
seme to sememe (and vice versa) by analyzing a line from Virgil: Pulnera
dirigere et co/amos armare veneno (Aeneides 1 0.1. 140).
The verse, which can be translated either as "to distribute wou nds
with poisoned arrows" or as "to smear with poison the arrows and hurl
them," plays on the fact that lvulnera dirigere/ stands for <<dirigere tela » (or
dirigere ictus, dirigere plagas, vulnerare). Let us suppose that vulnerare is
the right interpretation and imagine a semantic representation tn casegrammer form like the following:
/Vulnerare/ :::> (Entailments)
A 0
Action H uman Hu man
Strike
Wound
With aim
I
Weapon
p
Wound (1/u/nus)
Here is where the expression /aim the wounds/ appears as a metonymy
in place of « to wound », given that it takes the Goal for the whole Action 
Metaphor [115]
or, in other words, that a seme stands for the entire sememe. Of the
same type would be the Aristotelian example of Ito stand/ for « to lie at
anchor•• . Standing still would appear in the representation as the Goal of
anchoring. The opposite case (sememe for seme) would be to describe a
pa rked car as being firmly anchored. An encyclopedic representation of
/to stop/ would have to include even an anchor among its various instruments.
This type of representation seems to work for verbs but poses some
problems for nouns. How can an Agent, an Object, or an Instrument, in
fact, be found for such linguistic entities as house, sea, tree? One possible
suggestion would be to understand all substantives as 'reified' verbs or
actions: not house, then, but to build a house. But there is one type of
representation that seems to substitute for this difficult translation of
substantives into verbs, which permits seeing the obj ect expressed by
the substantive as the result of a productive action entailing an agent or
Cause, a Material to be manipulated , a Form to be imposed, and a Goal
or Purpose to direct the object toward. It is a representation based on
nothing other than the four Aristotelian causes (efficient, formal, material, and final), it being clear that these are assumed in merely operational terms and without metaphysical connotations.
Here, in the meantime, is the representation of a noun /x/, which
might take the following format:
/xl :> F A
Perceptual Who or what
aspect of x prod uces x
M p
What x is What x is supposed
made of to do or to serve for
Such a representation takes into account only encyclopedic properties,
without distinguishing between I and II properties. We shall see in
J . II.3 how these properties, potentially infinite, must be selected according to co-textual clues.
Each property can, however, be 'appointed' as a I property. Suppose
that /x/ is to be considered from the point of view of its Pu rpose: it will
be seen as belonging to the class of all the entities having the same
Purpose or function. In this case, one of the P properties will become
the genus of which the sememe «X » is a species; that is, one of the P
properties will become the upper node of a possible Porphyrian tree
( Figure 3. 7).
The same operation can be implemented upon F, M, or A properties.
A property's assumption of the I mode thus depends on a contextual
decision on the part of the interpreter (or the producer) of the metaphor,
who is interested in singling out a given property as the one from whose
point of view a generalizing or particularizing synecdoche in I can be set 
[ 1 1 6) SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
I n
p

lx/ F, A, M ...

forth. Thus /x/ will name all the «P>> , or /PI will name <<X>> . Supposing
that /x/ corresponds to /house/ and that it is represented, for the sake of
economy, as
/house/ :::> F A With roof Culture
M
B ricks
p Shelter
If one decides to consider a house from the point of view of its function,
the property of being a shelter becomes a I property, and it will then be
possible t� name a house as a shelter, or every shelter as a house. The
same would happen if the house were described from the point of view
of i ts shape: one can name a house as one's own roof, a house being a
species of the genus 'artifacts with a roof'.
I t i s worth noticing that house for shelter (and vice versa) traditionally
has been considered a case of metonymy (object for function, and vice
versa), while house for roof, or vice versa, has been traditionally considered a case of synecdoche (pars pro toto, a synecdoche in IT).
This difference, between metonymy and synecdoche in IT, becomes
absolutely irrelevant in the present framework. The only case of synecdochic movement seems to be in the I mode, produced by a co-textual
decision, and consisting in the transformation of a property into a genus.
All the other cases of substitution of a sememe with a seme, and vice
versa, can be called metonymy. Naturally, in our framework the difference between synecdoche and metonymy has nothing to do with the
concrete relations between a 'thing' and its parts or other contiguous
'things' : the difference lies purely within formal bases.
As a matter of fact, the traditional rhetoric has never satisfactorily explained why a s ubstitution ge nus/species (I) and a substitution
parsltotum (IT) are both synecdoches, whereas all the other kinds of substitution (obj ect/purpose , container/content, cause/effec t, material/obj ect, and so on) are called metonymies. In the present framework,
both a pars pro toto and a cause/effect substitution can work on IT properties.
The explanation of this ambiguity in the tradi tion must be made in
historical and phenomenological terms. According to many time-honored
theories of knowledge, things are first perceived and recognized accord-
Metaphor [117]
ing to their formal (morphologic) characteristics: a body is round or
heavy, a sound is loud or deep, a tactile sensation is hot or rough, and so
on. These morphological properties in our model are recorded under F.
Instead , always according to traditional theories of knowledge, to establish that a thing has a cause A, that it is made of a certain material M, or
that it has a function P seems to depend on fur ther inferences - by a sort
of shifting from a simple act of apprehension to an act of j udgment. It is
evident, then, why F properties enjoyed a privileged status and were
ranked as synecdoches along with the I relations (genus/species). To
perceive and to recognize the formal characteristics of a thing meant to
grasp its 'universal' essence, to recognize that thing as the individual of a
species related to a genus.
Obviously, such an assumption does not capture the complexity of a
perceptual experience, where frequently an object, to be recognized and
classified , requires a complex inferential labor, dealing with its functional, material , and causal aspects, as well . Our model eliminates the
effects of all these implicit philosophical assumptions. All properties
must be considered encyclopedic and must allow for metonymical
substitution - except when a property is transformed into a genus (substitution in I) because for co-textual reasons a given semantic i tem has
to be considerd under a certain 'generic' description (see also Eco 1 979,
8. 5. 2).
J. II.J. 'Topic', 'frames', isotopies
Naturally, an encyclopedic representation is potentially infinite. In a
given culture, a cup's functions can be many, and , of these, holding
liquid is only one. (One has only to think of the liturgical functions of a
chalice, or of cups in sports.) What, then, are the interpretants that will
have to be registered under the aspect P (purpose or function) of the
cup? And which will be those grouped under F, A, M? If they are not
infinite, they are at least indefinte. As I have written elsewhere, "a
semiotics of the code is an operational device in the service of a semiotics of
sign production. A semiotics of the code can be established - if only
partially - when the existence of a message postulates it as an explanatory
condition. Semiotics must proceed to isolate structures as if a definitive
general structure existed ; but to be able to do this one must assume that
this global structu re is a simply regulative hypothesis . . . " (1976:
128- 29). In other words, the universe of the encyclopedia is so vast (if
the hypothesis of infinite interpretation from sign to sign and thus of
unlimited semiosis is valid) that, in the instance (and u nder the pressure)
of a certain co-text, a given portion of the encyclopedia is activated and
proposed to explain the metonymical substitutions and their metaphorical results (see Eco 1 979, 2.6).
Where does this contextual pressure come from? Either (a) from the 
[1 18] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
identification of a theme or topic and, consequently, from the selection
of a path of interpretation or isotopy; or (b) from the reference to frames,
which permit us to establish not only what is being talked about, but
also under what profile, to what ends, and with what in view, it is being
talked about (see Eco 1 979, 0.6. 3).
3-114 Trivial metaphors and 'open' metaphors
Let us consider two elementary, even crude, examples of Icelandic riddles (kenningor) mentioned by Borges (1953): /The tree for sitting/ for
« bench» and /The house of the birds/ for « the sky». In the former
example, the first term (/tree/) contains no ambiguity. Let us construct
a componential spectrum:
/Tree/ ::J F
Trunk
B ranches
(Vertical)
A
Nature
M
Natural
wood
p
Fruits
As is clear in this first stage, we do not yet know which are the semes
that must be kept in mind contextually. The encyclopedia (a potential
reserve of information) would permit filling in this representation indefinitely. But the context gives as well the indication /or sitting. The expression as a whole is ambiguous. One does not sit on trees, or, alternatively, one can sit on every branch of every tree, but then it is hard to
u nderstand why the definite article the is used (which, according to
Brooke-Rose, is an indicator of metaphorical usage). This tree, then, is
not a tree. Something must be found that has some of a tree's properties,
but not others, requiring the tree to have properties that it does not have
(normally). We are faced with a task of abd uction (a kenning is a riddle
based on a 'difficult' metaphor). A series of hypotheses leads us to single
out in the tree trunk the element of 'verticality' , so as to look for something that is also wooden but 'horizontal' . We try a representation of to
sit. We look among those Objects on which an Agent sits for those that
have the seme of 'horizontal .' A primitive Icelander, or someone who
knows that the expression must bear a relation to the code of primitive
Icelandic culture, immediately picks out the bench.
We assemble the representation of bench:
/Bench/ ::J F A M
Horizontal Culture Worked
timber
p To seat
oneself
At first glance, the two sememes have no property in common. Now we
carry out a second operation: we look for those among the different 
Metaphor [ 1 1 9]
properties that can form part of the same Porphyrian tree (Figure 3.8).
Here we see tree and bench unified at a high node of the stem (both
things are vegetal) and opposed at lower nodes. This solution creates a
condensation by means of a series of displacements. Cognitively speaking, not much is learned, except for the fact that benches are made of
crafted timber.
Let us pass to the second riddle, The house of the birds. Here it is possible to assemble a dou ble representation immediately.

etc. (Organic) the sky
Obviously, certain semes have already been identified as the most pertinent here, on the basis of a series of hypotheses. The materials have
been characterized according to a logic of the elements (earth , air, water,
and fire), and an interesting difference has been found, at this point,
between the earthliness or earthbound property of houses and the airborne nature of birds (suggesting the seme 'sky'). These are mere
hypotheses (since many other alternatives exist); but it is a fact that this
metaphor is more 'difficult' than the other and, thus, that it requires
more daring abductions. So the interpreter can make a 'fair guess' out of
the opposition between a house (closed) and the sky (open). At this
point we can try to represent /sky/, keeping in mind, obviously, its
possible differences and similaritie,· with house:
/Sky/ :::> FF I A M

Nonshelter 
[120] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
Clearly, among the ends or functions of sky, only 'nonshelter' has been
identified, since the seme 'shelter' exists in house. At this point, though
it seems as though all the semes in the comparison house/sky are in
opposition. What is there that is similar? If we try a Porphyrian tree on
the opposition air/earth, we discover that these two units find a common
node in the property 'element' .
The interpreter is led , then, to draw infere nces concerning those
semes that have been singled out. One is led, in other words, to take the
various semes as th starting points for new semantic representations or
compositional analyses (see Eco 1976, 2. 1 2). The domain of the encyclopedia is widened : what is the territory of men and what is the territory
of birds? Men live in closed (or enclosed) territories, and birds in open
territories. What for man is something from which he must shelter himself is the natural shelter for birds. New Porphyrian trees are tried out:
closed dwelling or territory vs. open dwelling or territory. Birds 'live' , so
to speak, in the skies. It is this 'so to speak' that creates the condensation .. Frames or settings are superimposed. If a man is menaced, what
does he do? He takes refuge in his house. If a bird is menaced, it takes
refuge in the skies. Therefore, enclosed refuge vs. open refuge. But
then the skies that seemed a place of danger (producing wind, rain,
storm) for some beings become a place of refuge for others. This is a
case, then, of a metaphor that is 'good' or 'poetic' or 'difficult' or 'open' ,
since it is possible here to continue the process of semiosis indefinitely
and to find conjunctions or contiguities at one node of a given Porphyrian tree and d issimilarities at lower nodes, just as an entire slew of dissimilarities and oppositions are found in the encyclopedic semes. That
metaphor is 'good' which does not allow the work of interpretation to
grind to a halt (as occurred with the example of the bench), but which
permits inspections that are diverse, complementary, and contradictory.
Which does not appear to be different from the criterion of pleasure
cited by Freud (1905) to define a good joke: thrift and economy, to be
sure, but such that a shortcut is traced through the encyclopedic network, a labyrinth which would take away too much time if it were to be
explored in all its polydimensional complexity .
The problem now is to see whether this model of metaphorical production and interpretation holds true for other metaphorical expressions,
for the most exaggerated catachreses and for the most delicate poetic
inventions alike. We shall start by putting ourselves in the position of
someone who has to disambiguate The leg of the table for the first time. In
the beginning, it must have been a kenning, an enigma. One must know
first, though, what a table and a leg are. One finds in a (human) leg a
function P of sustaining or holding up a body. In the formal description
F of table, one finds the instruction that it is held up by four unnamed 
Metaphor [121]
elements. One hypothesizes a third term , body, and finds that in F it is
held up by two legs. The semes for vertical ity may be found both in leg
and in the object x holding up the table. One also finds differences and
oppositions between semes, such as 'nature vs. culture' , 'organic vs. inorganic' . Table and body are joined under a Porphyrian tree that considers articulated structures: we find that body and table meet at the
higher node and are distinguished from each other at the lower nodes
(for example, organic articu lated structures vs. inorganic articulated
structures). In the end, we might well ask if the catachresis is 'good .' We
do not know, it is too familiar, we will never again regain the innocence
of first invention. By now it is a ready-made syntagm, an element in the
code, a catachresis in the strict sense, and not an inventive metaphor.
Let us try out, then, two indisputably genuine metaphors: She was a
rose and, from Malherbc, Et rose elle a vecu ce que vivent les roses, l'espace
d'un matin.
The first metaphor right away says contextually what the metaphorizing term (or vehicle) is and who the metaphorized term (or tenor) is. She
cannot be anything other than a human being of the female sex. One
proceeds thus to the comparison of woman and rose. But the operation
can never be so completely ingenuous. The interpreter's intertextual
competence is already rich with ready-made expressions, with already
familiar frames. One already knows which semes to bring into focus and
which to drop (Figure 3.9). The comparison is of u nsettling simplicity.
The greater part of the encyclopedic semes is similar; there is opposition
only on the vegetal/animal axis. The Porphyrian tree is built on that
opposition, and we find that, despite opposition at the lower nodes,
there is a conjunction at the higher node (organic). But, in order to arrive
there, it was necessary, obviously, to know already that, when a woman
is compared to a flower, it is in terms of a woman-object, which , like the
flowers, lives for its own sake, purely as an ornament to the world. And ,
finally, the question of the similarity or dissi milarity between properties
becomes clear: it is neither perceptual nor ontological, but, rather,
semiotic. Language (the figurative tradition) must already have understood 'freshness' and 'color' as interpretants both of the healthy condition of a human body and of the healthy condition of a flower, even if
from a physical perspective the rosiness of a woman's cheek rarely has
the same spectral frequency as the red color of a flower. There is a
difference in millimicrons, but culture has blurred the distinction, naming two shades of color with the same word or representing them visually
with the same pigment.
This is a poor metaphor, then, scarcely cognitive, saying something
that is already known. However, no metaphor is absolutely 'closed': its
closure is pragmatic. If we imagine an ingenuous user of language who

encounters she is a rose for the first time, we will see him caught in a
game of trial and error, like the person who were to disambiguate for the
first time the house of the birds. There is no metaphor that is absolutely
'unpoetic' ; such metaphors exist only in particular sociocultural situations.
As for absolutely 'poetic' metaphors, it is impossible to say how much
a user knows of a language (or of every other semiotic system). What,
however, is known is what a language has already said , and it is possible
to recognize a metaphor that demands unprecedented interpretive operations, and the identification of semes not yet identified .
Malherbe's metaphor apparently demands the same work of comparison as did the preceding example. The problem of space is already resolved; tradition has already made it a metaphor of the passage of time.
Tradition has already secured the metaphorical use of life for the duration
of nonanimal entities. The relation between duration, young girl , rose,
and morning must be inspected, then. The seme of 'fleetingness' (already intertextually codified) will be recognized as particularly pertinent
to rose (the rose opens at dawn and closes at sunset; it lasts for a very
short time). All the other similarities between girl and rose will already
have been reviewed and taken as intertextually correct. As far as morning is concerned, it has the property of being the most beau tiful, delicate, and active hour of the day. Naturally, then, a maiden, fair as a
rose, has lived a fleeting life, and has lived only that part of it that, albeit
brief, is the best. (Aristotle, moreover, had already said: the morning of
life is yo u th.) Thus we find identity and d issimilarity between
encyclopedic markers, conjunction at a high node of the Porphyrian tree 
Metaphor [ 1 23]
(organic, or living), and difference at the low nodes (animal vs. vegetal).
The nceforth all the condensations in this example, of maid en and
flower, of vegetal life-pulse becoming carnal life-pulse, of dew turning
into moist eyes, of petals assuming the shape of mouths follow; the encyclopedia allows the imagination (even the visual) to gallop ahead , and
the continuous web of semiosis becomes animate with alliances and incompatibilities.
But some ambiguities remain. The rose lives one morning and it
closes at night, but only to see the light again the next day. The maiden
dies, instead, and is not reborn. Must one review, then, what is known
about death for human beings? Is there rebirth? Or must one review
what is known about the death of flowers? Is the rose that is reborn
tomorrow the same as yesterday's, or is yeste rday's that which was not
picked? The effect of the condensation is unstable; underneath the
cadaveral stiffening of the maiden, the long pulsation of the rose continues. Who wins? The life of the rose or the death of the maiden?
Obviously, there is no answer; the metaphor is, in point of fact,
'open' - even if it is sustained by a play of intertextually familiar overcodings that verges on the manneristic .
J.n .s. Five rules
We are now in a position to sketch a series of rules for the co-textual
interpretation of a metaphor (noting that the process of interpretation
maps out in reverse the process of production):
(a) Try to provide a first tentative and partial componential representation of the metaphorizing sememe or sememes (the vehicle). This representation must single out only those semes or properties that the co-text
has suggested as relevant. (For the processes of blowing up and narcotizing
properties, see Eco 1 979, 0. 6. 2). This operation represents a first
abductive attempt.
(b) Look abd uctively in the encyclopedia for some other sememe that
possibly shares some of the focused properties of the first sememe(s)
while displaying other, interestingly diff erent properties. This new sememe
becomes a plausible candidate for the role of metaphorized sememe
(tenor). If there are competing terms for this role, make further abductions based upon co-textual clues. It must be clear that by 'identical
properties' we mean those representable by the same interpretant. By
'interestingly d ifferent properties' we mean those that are representable
by interpretants that are not only different from each other, but that can
also be opposed according to some overcoded incompatibility (such as
open/closed, living/dead, and so on). 
[124] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
(c) Select one or more of the mutually different properties and build on
them one or more Porphyrian trees such that these oppositional couples
may join at one of its upper nodes.
(d) Tenor and vehicle display an interesting relationship when the ir
mutually different properties meet at as high a node as possible in the
Porphyrian tree.
Expressions such as 'interestingly different' and 'as high a node as possible' are not vague; they refer to a co-textual plausibility. Similarities
and differences can be evaluated only according to the co-textual success
of the metaphor, and we cannot look for a 'formal' criterion that establishes the proper degree of difference and the proper position in a Porphyrian tree. According to these rules, we start from metonymical relations {from seme to sememe) between two different sememes and by
checking the possibility of a double synecdoche (which interests both
vehicle and tenor); we finally accept the substitution of a sememe with
another. Thus the sememic substitution appears as the effect of a double
metonymy verified by a double synecdoche. From this point on, a fifth rule
holds:
(e) Check whether, on the grounds of the 'abduced' metaphors, new
relations can be implemented , so as to enrich further the cognitive
power of the trope.
3.1 1 .6. From metaphors to symbolic interpretation
Once the process of unlimited semiosis has started, it is difficult to say
where and when the metaphorical interpretation stops: it depends on the
co-text. There are cases in which from one or more metaphors the interpreter is led to an allegorical reading, or to a symbolic interpretation,
where the boundaries between metaphor, allegory, and symbol can be
very imprecise. ( For a distinction between these three notions, see
Chapter 4.)
On this score, Weinrich (1976) has posited an interesting distinction
between micrometaphorics, metaphorics of the context and metaphorics of the
text. Let us briefly follow his analysis of a lengthy passage from Walter
Benj amin , of which only the most salient points will be summarized
here. In the text Seagulls (Mowen), Benjamin speaks of a trip by sea that
he made, a voyage that is dense with metaphors which will not be
analyzed here. Two, however, appear singular to Weinrich : the seagulls,
peoples of winged creatures, winged messengers, bound in a pattern of
signs, which at a moment divide into two rows, one black, vanishing
westward into thin air, the other row white, pulling toward the east, still
present and 'to be resolved' ; and the mast of the ship, which describes
in the air a pendular movement. Weinrich develops first a micrometaphorics 
Metaphor [ 1 25]
(for example, of common and dissimilar properties between mast and
pendulum) and then a metophorics of the context, where he connects the
various 'metaphorical fields' activated by Benjamin. In brief, something
slowly emerges that begins to look increasingly like an allegorical
enunciation, which in the final stage of the metophorics of the test reveals
its politico-ideological key (whereby the text is considered also in terms
of the historical circumstances of its enunciation): the year 1929, the
crisis of the Weimar Republic, the contradictory situation of the German
intellectual, on one side obsessed by the extreme polarization of contrasts (friend vs. enemy), on the other uncertain about what position to
take, and oscillating between neutrality and a dogmatic surrender to one
of the pa rties. Hence the mast that becomes a metaphor for the
« pendulum of historical events», and the antagonistic contrast between
the seagulls.
Regardless of whether Weinrich's reading is correct or not, let us return to the metaphor of the mast-pendulum, to identify its constitutive
mechanism, which must permit all the contextual inferences that the
reader (in the case postulated as a Model Reader) may possibly draw. We
will go right past the stage of finding those contextual pressures that lead
the reader to select certain semes at the expense of others, and draw the
componential spectrum of the two terms present in the context: most and
pendulum. In effect, the text does speak of a "pendular movement"
(Pendelbewegungen ), so that more than of metaphor we should speak of a
simile (the mast moves as though it were a pendulum). But the specific
effect of condensation is not affected by this.
The representation of mast and of pendulum is as follows:
/Mast/ ::> F A M p
Perticol Culture Wood Support
Fixed Iron for sails
Blocked at Permits movement of ship
base Space
Slight oscillation
Ship
/Pendulum/ ::> F A M p
f/erticol Culture Wood Coun terweight
Mobile Iron Permits movement of hands
Blocked Time
at top Sensible oscillation
Time-piece
We can see immediately on which semes the identity may be established and on which the difference may be based. A hasty conjunction in
a given Porphyrian tree would give disappointing results: both a mast 
[1 26] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
and a pendulum are handcrafted, both are of wood or iron, or, at the
very least, both belong to the class of vertical things. This is just not
enough . The only oppositions worth noticing seem to be that between
fixity and oscillation, and the fact that the one must be referred to intervals in space and the other to intervals in time. At a second inspection, we
see that even a mast, while staying fixed, must oscillate somewhat, j ust
as a pendulum to oscillate must be fixed at its peg. But this is still not a
cognitive acquisition worth nothing. A pendulum fixed at its top end
oscillates and measures time, and a mast fixed at its base oscillates and
in some way is bound to the dimension of space - which we already
knew.
If this metaphor had appeared in a context that d ropped it immediately, without taking it any further, it would not constitute an invention worthy of emphasis. In this analysis Weinrich shows that the
intertextual framework focuses the interpreter's attention on the th'!me
of oscillation; moreover, within the same context, the insistence on the
play of alternation among the seagulls and on the oppositions right/left
and east/west establishes an isotopy of tension between two poles. This
is the isotopy prevailing at the deepest levels, and not that which is
established by the topic 'trip by sea' at the level of discursive structures
(see Eco 1 979). The reader is led , then, to shift the center of semiosis to
the seme of oscillation - which is the primary function of a pendulum
and secondary for a mast (the encyclopedia must begin to acknowledge a
hierarchy of semes). Moreover, the pendulum's oscillation is functionally
adapted to precise measurement, whereas that of a mast is more casual.
The pendulum oscillates in an unfaltering, constant manner, without
any changes of rhythm, whereas the mast is subject to changes and, at
the worst, to fractures. The fact that the mast is functionally adapted to
a ship (open to movement within space and to idefinite adventure) and
that a pendulum is functionally adapted to being a timepiece, fixed in
space and regular in its measurement of time, opens the way to successive oppositions: the certainty of a pendulum against the uncertainty of a
mast, the one closed and the other open ... ; and then, naturally, the
relation of the mast (uncertain) to the two contradictory peoples of seagulls ... ; as can be seen, our reading can go on ad infinitum. By itself,
the metaphor is a poor one; set in its context it sustains other metaphors
and is by them sustained.
Others have attempted to define the value of a metaphor according to
the greater or lesser 'distance' between the properties of the terms
brought into focus; it does not seem to me, though, that there is such a
rigorous rule. It is the encyclopedic model constructed for the purposes
of interpreting a given context that sets ad hoc the center and periphery
of the relevant semes. There remains the criterion of the greater or lesser openness, that is, of how far a metaphor allows us to travel along the 
Metaphor [1 27]
pathways of semiosis and to discover the labyrinths of the encyclopedia.
In the course of such traverses, the terms in question are enriched with
properties that the encyclopedia did not yet grant them.
These considerations do not yet definitely establish an aesthetic criterion for distinguishing 'beautiful' metaphors from those that are 'ugly' .
On that score, even the strict relations between expression and content
and between form and substance of expression come into play (in poetry
one might speak of musicality, of the possibility of memorizing both
contrast and similarity, and thus such elements as rhyme, paronomasia,
and assonance enter one's consideration). But these considerations do
permit us to distinguish the closed (or scarcely cognitive) metaphor from
that which is open, thereby enabling us to know better the possibilities
of semiosis or, in other words, precisely of that categorical index of
which Tesauro spoke.
3.12. Conclusions
No algorithm exists for the metaphor, nor can a metaphor be produced
by means of a computer's precise i nstructions, no matter what the volume of organized i nformation to be fed in. The success of a metaphor is
a function of the sociocultu ral format of the interpreting subjects' encyclopedia. In this perspective, metaphors are p roduced solely on the basis
of a rich cultural framework, on the basis, that is, of a universe of content that is already organized into networks of interpretants, which decide (semiotically) the identities and differences of properties. At the
same time, content universe, whose format postulates itself not as rigidly
hierarchized but, rather, accordi ng to Model Q, alone derives from the
metaphorical production and interpretation the opportunity to restructure i tself into new nodes of similarity and dissimilarity.
But this situation of unlimited semiosis does not exclude the existence
of first tropes, of 'new' metaphors, in other words, never before heard of
or, at least, experienced as though they were never before heard . The
co nditions of occ u rrence for such tropes , which we might term
metaphorically 'auroral' (but which in Eco 1 975 are defined as instances
of invention ), are multiple:
(a) There always exists a context that is capable of reproposing as new a
codified catachresis or dead metaphor. One can imagine a text of the
ecole du regard in which , by means of an obsessive description of our
perceptual activity, the force and vividness of such an expression as the
neck of the bottle is rediscovered.
(b) In shifting from one semiotic system to another, a dead metaphor
becomes an inventive one anew. Think of Modigliani's female portraits,
which , it could be said, visually reinvent (but also oblige us to rethink 
[1 28] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
even conceptually and, through various mediations, verbally) an expression such as neck of a swan. Investigations of the visual metaphor (see
Bonsiepe 1965) have shown how a worn-out expression such as flexible
(used to indicate openness of mind , lack of prej udice in decision making, sticking-to-the-facts) can reclaim a certain freshness when , instead
of being uttered verbally, it is translated visually through the representation of a flexible object.
(c) The context with an aesthetic function always posits its own tropes as
'first' : insofar as it obliges one to see them in a new manner and arranges
a quantity of correlations between the various levels of the text so as to
permit an ever new interpretation of the specific expression (which
never functions alone, but which always interacts with some new aspect
of the text; see the i mage of the mast/pe ndulum in Benjamin).
Moreover, it is characteristic of contexts having an aesthetic function to
produce objective correlatives, which have an extremely 'open' metaphorical function inasmuch as they give one to understand that relations of
similarity or of identity may be postulated without the possibility of
those relations being further clarified . At this point, one frequently
speaks of symbol .
(d) The 'deadest' trope can work 'like new' for the any 'virgin' subject,
approaching for the first time the complexity of the semiosis. Both restricted and elaborate codes exist. Imagine a subject who has never
heard of comparing a girl to a rose, who ignores the intertextual institutio nalizations, and who responds even to the most worn-out
metaphors as though discovering for the first time the relations between
a woman's face and a flower. The kinds of metaphorical communication
may also be explained on the same basis, the cases, namely, in which
the 'idiot' subject is incapable of understanding figurative language or
perceives its functions in a labored manner, experiencing it only as a
bothersome provocation. Situations of the kind also arise in the translating of metaphors from one language to another: there are equal chances
of a translation producing puzzling obscurity or limpid intelligibility.
(e) There are privileged cases, finally, in which the subject 'sees' for the
first time a rose, notices its freshness, its petals pearled with dew ­
because previously the rose for him had only been a word or an object
espied in the windows of a florist. In such cases the subject reconstructs,
so to speak, his own sememe, enriching it with properties, not all verbalized or verbalizable, some interpretable and interpreted by other visual or tactile experiences. In this p rocess various syn aesthesic
phenomena compete in constituting networks of semiosic relations.
These reinvented metaphors are born of the very same reason that one 
Metaphor [129]
tells one's own symptoms to a doctor in an improper manner (My chest is
burning . . . I feel pins and needles in my arms . .. ). In this way a metaphor
is reinvented through ignorance of the lexicon, as well.
And yet, these first tropes themselves arise because every time there
is an underlying semiotic network. Vico would remind us that men know
how to speak as heroes because they already know how to speak as men.
Even the most ingenuous metaphors are made from the detritus of other
metaphors - language speaking itself, then - and the line between first
and last tropes is very thin, not so much a question of semantics as of the
pragmatics of interpretation. At any rate, for too long it has been thought
that in order to understand metaphors it is necessary to know the code
(or the encyclopedia): the truth is that the metaphor is the tool that
permits us to understand the encyclopedia better. This is the type of
knowledge that the metaphor stakes out for us.
In order to arrive at this conclusion, we had to give up looking for a
synthetic, immediate, blazing definition of the metaphor: substitution,
leap, abbreviated simile, analogy .... Because the way in which one
seems to understand a metaphor is simple, it is easy to be deluded into
thinking that the metaphor is capable of being defined by means of a
simple category. This simplicity, it must be noted , this felicitousness in
making shortcuts within the process of semiosis, is a neu rological fact.
Semiotically speaking, instead , the process of metaphorical production
and interpretation is long and tortuous. It is not at all a given that the
explanation of the immediate physiological or psychic processes must be
equally immediate. In his collection of classical Witze, Freud quotes this
aphorism of Lichtenberg: "He marveled that cats should have two slits
in their skin, j ust where their eyes are." And Freud comments: "The
stupefaction exhibited here is only apparent; in reality this simplistic
observation conceals within it the great problem of teleology in the structure of animals. That the flap of the eyelid should open where the
cornea is exposed is not at all obvious, at least not until the history of
evolution has made clear for us this coincidence" (1905 , J . I). Behind the
'felicitousness' of natural (physical and psychic) processes, remains hidden a long labor. I have tried here to define some of the phases of that
labor. 
Symbol
What is a symbol? E tymologically speaking, the word u vp.{30AOJ) comes
from uvp.{3aAAW, to throw-with, to make something coincide with something else: a symbol was originally an identification mark made up of two
halves of a coin or of a medal. Two halves of the same thing, either one
standing for the other, both becoming, however, fully effective only
when they matched to make up, again, the original whole. In the
semiotic dialectics between signifier and signified , expression and content, or name and thing, such a rejoining is always deferred , the first half
of the couple being always interpreted by our substitu tion of another first
half of another couple, and so on in infinitum, so that the initial gap
between signans and signatum grows more and more . On the contrary, in
the original concept of symbol, there is the suggestion of a final recomposition. E tymologies, however, do not necessarily tell the truth - or, at
least, they tell the truth, in terms of historical, not of structural, semantics. What is frequently appreciated in many so-called symbols is exactly
their vagueness, their openness, their fruitful ineffectiveness to express
a 'final' meaning, so that with symbols and by symbols one indicates
what is always beyond one's reach.
Are there in the specialized lexicons more technical definitions of this
category and of the corresponding term? Alas. One of the most pathetic
moments in the history of philosophical terminology is when the collaborators of the Dictionnaire de philosophie of Lalande (1926) gather to
discuss the definition of /symbol/. This page of a 'technical' lexicon is
pu re Ionesco.
After a first definition, according to which a symbol is something representing something else by virtue of an analogical correspondence (for
example, the sceptre, symbol of regality - where it is not clear where
the analogy lies, because this is a paramount case of metonymic
[130] 
Symbol [1 3 1]
continguity), a second definition is proposed, namely, that symbols concern a continued system of terms, each of which represent an element of
another system. It is a good definition for the Morse code; unfortunately, the following definition speaks of a system of uninterrupted
metaphors, and the Morse code seems hardly definable as a metaphorical
system. At this point, Lalande adds that a symbol is also a "formulary of
orthodoxy" and quotes the Credo. A discussion follows: Delacroix insists
on the analogy; Lalande asserts to have received by 0. Karmin the proposal of defining as a symbol every conventional re presentation;
Bru nschvicq speaks of an "internal" representational power and mentions the archetypical circular image of the serpent biting its own tail;
van Biema reminds the party that the fish was the symbol of Christ only
for acronymic reasons; Lalande wonders how a piece of paper can become the symbol for a given amount of gold, while a mathematician
speaks of symbols for the signs of the square root; Delacroix is caught by
the suspicion that there is no relation between the sign for square root
and the fox as a symbol for cunning; someone else distinguishes between intellectual and emotional symbols, and the entry fortunately
stops at this point. The effort of Lalande has not been fruitless; it has
suggested that a symbol can be everything and nothing. What a shame.
There are undoubtedly among all the definitions above some family
resemblances. But family resemblances have a curious property (see, for
instance, Bambrough 1 961). Let us consider three concepts A, B, and C
analyzable in terms of component properties a . . . g ( Figure 4. 1 ). It is
clear that every concept possesses some of the properties of the others,
but not all of them. But let us now broaden the series according to the
same criterion (Figure 4. 2).

At the end no common property will unite A with F, but one; they
belong to the same network of family resem blance. . . .
When speaking apropos of the concept of sign, it seems that it is possible to outline a unique definition that can take into account the various 
[ 1 32] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
senses attributed to this expression, thus establishing a proper, abstract
object for a general semiotics. On the contrary, it seems that, when facing the various occurrences of a term such as symbol , such an univocity
is impossible.
Symbol is not an expression of everyday language . A word such as sign
occurs in many ready-made syntagms, and, when one is unable to give a
univocal definition of the isolated term, one is still able to give a certain
interpretation of these syntagms. It is, on the contrary, the pseudoeveryday language of the press or of literary criticism that says that certain merchandises are the symbol of the productivity of a given country,
that Marilyn Monroe was a sex symbol, that the terrorists attempted to
assassinate the American ambassador in Rome for symbolic reasons, that
a certain word, description, or episode has to be read symbolically. A
common speaker would have some difficulty in explaining the 'right'
sense of these and of other similar expressions.
In his exhaustive survey of all the possible uses of symbol, Firth (1973)
remarks that this term is used in the place of sign when there is a certain
ineff ectuality: a 'symbolic' gesture does not attempt to get immediate
concrete effects. He notices that there is a web of contrasting relationships, from concrete to abstract (fox for cunning), from abstract to concrete (logical symbols), of vague metaphors (darkness for mystery); at its
first level a symbol can also be conventional (the keys of Saint Peter for
the power of the church), but, as soon as the symbol is considered in
transparence, one finds in it new and less conventional meanings (since
it is unclear what the gesture of jesus, when he gives the keys to Peter,
means exactly - moreover, why jesus does give the keys, not materially,
but 'symbolically' ).
At the end of his survey, Firth shows a propensity for a provisional and
'pragmatic' definition: "In the interpretation of a symbol the conditions
of its presentation are such that the interpreter ordinarily has much scope
for exercising his own judgement .... Hence one way of distinguishing
broadly between signal and symbol may be to class as symbols those
presentations where there is much greater lack of fit - even perhaps
intentionally - in the attribution of the fabricator and interpreter"
(1973 : 66 - 67). A reasonable conclusion, stressing the vagueness of
meaning and the gap between the intentions of the sender and the conclusions of the addressee. However, we cannot ignore that other theories
provide different and far more contrasting definitions.
Thus, on the provisional basis of Firth's suggestion, we shall try three
complementary critical moves:
(a) We must first isolate these cases in which /symbol/ is plainly equivalent to «sign» as defined above in chapter one. This first decision is 
Symbol [133]
certainly a terminologically biased one. It would not be forbidden to
decide that it is better to call symbols what we have called signs, therefore considering signs a subclass of symbols. Why decide that signs will
be a genus of which symbols (if any) are a species? There is, however, a
reason for our choice: there are many people who call symbols what we
call signs, but fewer people who call signs what other people call symbols. It seems, in other words, that, in the couple sign/symbol, only the
second term is the marked one; if there are theories where symbol is unmarked, there are no theories where sign is marked).
(b) Provided that sign expresses a genus, we shall then isolate many
species of it that do not display the properties that, according to Firth,
we have tentatively assigned to the symbolic experience.
(c) At this point we shall look for a 'hard core' sense of symbol, that is,
for a specific semantico-pragmatic phenomenon that we decide to label
as symbolic mode.
The diagram in Figure 4- 3 tries thus to outline the series of semiotic
phenomena labeled as symbolic by many theories and that in the following sections (4. I - 4. 3) will be excluded from the rank of symbols. We
shall see that many of them can provide polysemous interpretations, but
that these interpretations are always controlled by certain rules (be they
lexical, rhetorical , and so on). Once having eliminated all these improper
senses, we shall be in the position to give a survey of many instances of a
properly called symbolic mode (see 4.4) as well as to provide a tentative
description of the textual strategies implemented in order to produce
interpretations in the symbolic mode (see 4.5).

( 1 34] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
4.1. Genus and species
There are, first of all, theories that identify the symbolic with semiotic
activity in its entirety. In these perspectives symbolic activity is that by
which man organizes his own experience into a system of contents conveyed by an expression system. The symbolic is the activity by which
experience is not only coordinated but also communicated.
Goux (1973) has shown that such a notion of symbolic activity underlied Thinker's theory, thus permitting the dialectic between structu res and
superstructures (see also Rossi-Landi 1 974). Semiotic and symbolic activities are identical in Levi-Strauss structuralism: culture is an ensemble
of "symbolic systems" such as language, marriage rules, economical relationships, art, science , and religion (1950). The possibility of the
mutual transformation among structures is permitted by the existence of
a more profound symbolic ability of the human mind, which organizes
the whole of our experience according to the same modalities.
The symbolic and the semiotic also coincide in Lacan's thought. The
registers of the psychoanalytic field are the imaginary, the real, and the
symbolic. The i maginary is characterized by the relation between an
image and a similar object, but the similarity of which Lacan speaks is
not the one of so-called iconic signs; it is a phenomenon that takes place
within the very perceptual mechanism. Men experience a mere relationship of similari ty (an imaginary one) in the mirror stage, in the erotic
dual relationship, in many cases of isomorphism. In "Seminar I" (1953),
Lacan considers these images that in catoptrics are called ' real' images,
produced by curved mirrors (as opposed to the 'virtual' i mages of the
plane mirrors) and that appear and disappear according to the position of
the looking subject. This physical experience is used as an allegory of
the constitution of the psychic subject, which is produced as subjective
self-identity only by the phenomenon of the symbolic. The subject is an
effect of the symbolic; the symbolic is the determining 'order' of the
subject. Whereas the imaginary is a simple relation between the ego and
its i mages, the symbolic produces the subject through the language (Ia
parole) and realizes its closed order by the Law (the Nom-du-pere). Only
through the symbolic is the subject connected with the real, which is, so
to speak, its umbilical cord. In Freud the symbolic is a storage of oneiric
symbols endowed with a constant signification (see 4. 2.4); that is, Freud
attempts to set up a code of symbols. Lacan, on the contrary, flattens the
relation between expression and content by considering only the internal
logic of signifiers (see 1 . 5.4). As happens with Levi-Strauss, Lacan is not
concerned with the organization of sign-functions; he is, rather, concerned with the structural arrangements of signifiers. In "Seminar I'' he
says that thinking means to substitute elephants with the word elephant, 
Symbol [1 35]
and the sun with a circle. But the sun, insofar as it is designated by a
circle, is nothing if this circle is not inserted within a system of other
formalizations that, in their entirety, set up the symbolic order. A symbol becomes a signifying entity when it is inserted within a world of
symbols (undoubtedly for Lacan the symbolic order is an s-code). In this
sense Lacan speaks of symbols both for a word as elephant and for a visual
sign as the sun-circle, even though the symbolic model he is more interested in is undoubtedly the verbal one. Lacan is not so interested in a
typology of signs as he is in the general category of symbolic. It is, however, clear that for Lacan the symbolic order is what we can call the
semiotic one. It is true that, in his interpretive practice, he i ntroduces
elements of what we shall call the symbolic mode. But this happens at
the level of the interpretation of oneiric-verbal texts. From the point of
view of a general definition, Lacan identifies the symbolic with the
semiotic in general.
Symbolic and semiotic are the same also for Cassirer (The Philosophy of
Symbolic Forms, 1 923). Science does not mirror the structure of being
(considered as the unattainable Kantian thing-in-itself): "The fundamental concepts of each science, the instruments with which it propou nds its questions and formulates its solutions, are regarded no longer
as passive images of something but as symbols created by the intellect
itself." (ibid.; E ng. tr. p. 75) Cassirer mentions Hertz and Helmholtz's
theory of scientific obj ects as 'inner fictions' or symbols of outward objects: "These symbols are so constituted that the necessary logical consequences of the image are always images of the necessary natural consequences of the imagined objects" (ibid . ). Cassirer does not identify
symbols only with those models or diagram rules by ratio dijficilis (see
4. 2.3 below); his purpose is a wider one. He deals with the Kantian
theory of knowledge as if it were a semiotic theory (even though Cassirer's a priori is more similar to a cultural product than to a transcendental structure of human mind): the symbolic activity does not
'name' an already known world, but establishes the very conditions for
knowing it. Symbols are not translations of our thought; they are its organs:
The logic of th ings, i.e. , of the material concepts and relations on which the
structure of a science rests, cannot be separated by the logic of signs. For
the sign is no mere accidental cloak of the idea, but its necessary and essential organ. It serves not merely to communicate a complete and given
thought content, but is an instrument, by means of which this con tent
develops and fully defines itself .... Consequently, all truly strict and exact
though t is sustained by the symbolic and semiotics on which it is based . (Ibid.,
pp. Bs - 86) 
[1 36] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
4.2. Expression by ratio facilis
4.2.1. Symbols as conventional expressions
Peirce defines an icon as "a sign which refers to the Object that it denotes merely by virtue of characters of its own ," an index as "a sign
which refers to the Object that it denotes by virtue of being really affected by that Object," and a symbol as "a sign which refers to the
Obj ect that it denotes by virtue of a Law, usually an association of general ideas .... It is thus itself a general type" (C. P. 2 . 249).
As such, a symbol is correlated to its Object by an arbitrary and conventional decision. In this sense words are symbols insofar as their lexical content depends on a cultural decision. Since Peirce had decided to
use the term sign for the genus generalissimum of semiotics, he had to
decide whether to reserve symbol for iconic s igns (as Saussure and
Hjelmslev did; see 4. 3 . 1) or for the category of arbitrary signs. He made
his choice following a rather frequent scientific usage, by which symbols
are conventional signs standing for chemical , physical , or mathematical
entities. It is true that Peirce knew very well that these scientific symbols display many 'iconic' qualities (as we shall see when speaking in
4. 3. I of expression prod uced by ratio difficilis and conveying a 'literal'
meaning), but it is also true that Peirce never identified something as a
mere symbol or as a mere icon. In any case, his decision contrasts with
the most common terminological usage, and he certainly never thought
that symbols convey a vague meaning. On the contrary, he speaks of
symbols for those expressions that mean directly and univocally what
they are designed to mean.
Curiously enough, m any call symbols in the Pei rcean sense those
stylizations (such as flags, emblems, astrological and chemical symbols)
that Peirce would have recognized as abundantly endowed with iconic
qualities. Probably at their very beginning, the alchemical symbol for the
Balneum Mariae and the astrological symbol for Lion displayed some
more or less evident 'analogy' with their content, but nowadays they
function as conventional devices. E mblems, coats of arms, and other
heraldic devices do have a second sense: an image represents in first
instance a tree, a hill, a city while its heraldic meaning is another one.
But they are visual allegories whose meanings - even though multiple
and difficult to guess - are already coded . Thus either they are symbols
in the Peircean sense or they are 'literal' expressions ruled by ratio difjicilis; in both cases they must be excluded from the rank of the instances of a symbolic mode.
4.2.2. Symbols as expressions conveying an indirect meaning
The full content of a sign can be actualized only by progressive interpretations. But the notion of interpretation (rooted in the one of infe rence) 
Symbol [ 1 37]
is not sufficient to characterize the symbolic mode. It characterizes every
semiotic phenomenon at large.
There are, however, many expressions (usually sentences or texts)
that suggest, beyond their prima facie interpretable 'conventional' or 'lexical' meaning, an additional 'intended meaning' (see Grice 1 957). If I
tell a lady that I saw her husband at a cozy restaurant with a beautiful
girl , I undoubtedly try to convey along with the literal meaning the intended meaning that the lady's husband is unfaithful to her. This second
meaning is certainly 'indirect' , and, as such, it must be actualized by an
inferential labor on the part of the addressee; nevertheless, it is neither
vague nor ambiguous.
Todorov (1978), aware of the difficulty of assigning a univocal sense to
the term symbol, decides to provide a framework within which all its
contrasting definitions can find a place, and wants to keep as "plural"
what is in fact irreducible to a unique definition. In doing so, however,
he accepts the line of thought criticized above; he identifies symbols
with the whole gamut of indirect and even of direct meanings: connotations, presuppositions, implications, implicatures, figures of speech, intended meaning, and so on. Once again the symbolic is identified with
the semiotic in general, since it is impossible to think of discourses that
do not elicit some inferential response.
Many of the devices people call symbols have something to do with
these phenomena of 'indirect' meaning, but not every device conveying
an indirect meaning can be called symbolic. Every semiotic device can
be used, if not from the point of view of the sender, at least from the
point of view of the interpreter, in order to actualize further meanings.
All these instances of indirect meaning say what they are intended to
say on the basis of contextual inferences governed by semantic or pragmatic rules. What the sender intends to express, what he wishes to be
understood , is so precise that the sender would be irritated if the addressee did not understand it. On the contrary, the genuine instances of
a symbolic mode seem to be those where neither the sender nor the
addressee really wants or is able to outline a definite interpretation.
4·3· Expressions produced by ratio difficilis
4·3· 1. Symbols as diagrams
Saussure called symbols what Peirce called icons, and Hjelmslev ranked
diagrams and games among the 'symbolic systems' , meaning by symbolic
systems those which are interpretable but not biplanar. Thus Hjelmslev
listed among symbols those signs that are isomorphic with their interpretation, such as in
the case of pure games, in the interpretation of which there is an entity of
content corresponding to each entity of expression (chesspiece or the like), 
[ 1 38] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
so that if two planes arc tentatively posited the fu nctional net will be
entirely the same in both . . . . Symbol should be used only for entities that
are isomorphic with their in terpre tation, entities that are depictions or
emblems, like Thorvaldsen's Christ as a symbol for compassion, the hammer and the sickle as a symbol for Communism .... There seems to be an
essential affinity between the interpretable pieces of a game and isomorphic
symbols, in that neither permits the fu rther analysis into figu res . . . .
(1943: 1 13 - 1 1 4)
Saussure and Hjelmslev spoke in fact of signs ruled by ratio difficilis
(Eco 1 976, 3.4.9) where the expression maps, according to preestablished projection rules, some features of the corresponding content. In
this sense one can call symbols those used by algebra and formal logic, at
least insofar as their syntactic structure is concerned. They are such because every transformation performed upon the syntactical arrangement
of the expression mirrors a possible rearrangement in the structure of
their content. If, on a geographical map, one alters the borderline between France and Germany, one can forecast what would happen if in a
possible world (the new content corresponding to the manipulated expression) the geopolitical definition of both countries were different. An
algebraic formula and a map are diagrams. That is why in electrotechnics
Seinmetz and Kennelly (following Hel mholtz} called 'symbolic' the
method postulating biunivocal correspondence between the emsemble
of sinusoidal functions of the same frequency (which incidentally are
expressed by mere conventional and by no means 'analogical' devices)
and the ensemble of points upon an Arnauld-Gauss plane of rotating
vectors. The rotation of a vector is a diagram that implies different
sinusoidal functions.
It is, however, clear that there is a difference between diagrams and
other phenomena labeled as symbols. Diagrams are based on precisely
coded transformational and projective rules, in the same way in which in
a m usical score the 'symbolic' relation between rising points on the stave
(spatial height} and frequency increments (phonic height} are ruled by a
precise proportional criterion. On the contrary, many so-called symbols
are characterized by the vagueness of their content and by the fact that
the correlation is not precoded but invented at the same moment in
which the expression is produced . In Hjelmslev's definition the category
of symbols encompasses both phenomena, without acknowledging the
radical difference between the way in which the Christ of Thorwaldsen
is a symbol for compassion and the way in which a move on the
chessboard has a symbolic nature. A different chess move would imply
different interpretations of the further course of the game, whereas we
do not know how many manipulations the Christ of Thorwaldsen should
undertake in order to stand for something other than compassion. 
Symbol [1 39]
Moreover, a diagram such as the map of a subway is certainly ruled by
ratio difficilis, but it is neither vague nor indirect: its meaning is a 'literal'
one; one can extrapolate from one's operations upon the map a precise
possible state of affairs. It could not be said that this possible state of
affairs is a sort of 'second' sense that the map conveys. In the same way
as one can interpret the word father by inferring that if there is a father
there should be either a son or a daughter, thus, if one detects on the
map that, for reaching the node C from the node A, one must pass
through the node B, one can infer that, if A and C were tied by a direct
connection, the B would be avoided . In both cases the word and the
map tell what they tell as soon as they are correctly interpreted accordi ng
to given cultural criteria.
Rather different, on the contrary, is the image of the serpent biting its
own tail. It is defined as a symbol because there is the strong feeling that
it not only represents a snake in an unusual position but that it also aims
at communicating something more.
4.3.2. Symbols as tropes
4·3·2.1. Oneiric symbols. In The Interpretation of Dreams ( 1 899), Freud
speaks of oneiric symbols. Dreams convey i mages which stand for something else, and Freud is interested in establishing how a "latent content" is organized by the oneiric labor into the form of a "manifest content." The latent content is transformed by the d ream distortion (ibid.,
4), and the dream is the disguised fulfillment of repressed wishes. Freud
does not interpret (as the ancient oneiromancy used to do) d reams as
organic allegories. Allegories do have a logic, whereas d reams do not.
The psychoanalytic interpretation does not work upon organic oneiric
discourses but upon fragments and their idiosyncratic mechanisms of
substitution . Dreams work through condensation and displacement, and
(even though Freud does not say it explicitly}, since they do not have a
logic, they have a rhetoric. Condensation and displacement are modalities of tropic substitution.
In the dream of the botanical monography ( 1 899, 6a) the botanic symbol condenses Gartner, Flora, the forgotten flowers, the flowers loved by
the author's wife, a u niversity exam: "Each of the elements of the
dream's content turns out to have been 'overdetermined' - to have been
represented in the dream-thoughts many times over" ( 1 899; Eng. tr. , 4,
p. 283).
Freud ·knows that the oneiric image is correlated to its content by a
sort of ratio difficilis, since it displays certain features that in some way
map equivalent features of the latent content. But, as happens in all
cases of ratio difficilis, the mapping relationship takes place between
selected features of the expression and selected feature of the content. To 
[1 40] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
decide which properties have to be selected, that is, which properties are
co-textually pertinent, is exactly the typical labor performed by d reams,
accord ing to certain requirements of plasticity, immediacy, representability ( 1 899, 6d).
Freud knows that oneiric symbols are not 'ste nographi c' signs
endowed with a preestablished meaning; however, he tries to anchor
these expressions to an interpretable content. To find such an anchorage, Freud distinguishes between those oneiric symbols produced by
idiosyncratic reasons, which must be interpreted by using the patient's
associations as their idiolectal encyclopedia, and those whose symbolism
"is not peculiar to d reams, but is characteristic of unconscious ideation,
in particular among the people, and it is to be found in folklore, and,in
popular myths, legends, linguistic idioms, proverbial wisdom, and current jokes" (1899; Eng. tr. , 5, p. 35 1). It is true that every d reamer
shows a remarkable plasticity in employing the most disparate images for
symbolic purposes, but Freud tries repeatedly (see the various editions
of the book, 1 909, 191 1, 1919) to find out a symbolic code so as to explain
the intersubjective (or cultural) meaning of umbrellas, sticks, railway
travels, staircases, and so on.
To look for an oneiric code means to touch on the hypothesis of a
collective unconscious, as jung will do; but F reud understands that in
doing so one risks going backward , to the very sources of human mental
activity, where there will no longer be a code. On the other hand, a code
is i ndispensable in order to speak intersubjectively of a semantics of
dreams beyond the idiosyncratic attitudes of the dreaming subj ects.
Thus Freud links the decoding of oneiric symbols to verbal puns, and in
doing so he suggests that the knowledge of linguistic mechanisms can
help one to understand the oneiric strategies of condensation and displacement. (The Lacanian decision to anchor the order of the imaginary
to the order of the symbolic must be understood in this sense.) Freud
suggests that the code can be reconstructed and that it is neither universal nor innate, but is historical , semiotic, and depends on the cultural
encyclopedia of the dreamer.
This assumption is not, however, so unambiguous. The d ream must
be interpreted according to a linguistic and cultural competence ( that is,
according to a competence which is external to the world of dreams);
nevertheless, every oneiric image can be polysemous, as Freud explicitly
says, and must be referred to the idiolect of the d reamer as well as to the
whole d ream as its co-text. Notwithstanding these perplexities and contradictions, Freud is undoubtedly looking for 'correct' interpretations of
d reams, and in this sense his oneiric symbols are not constitutively
vague.
Freud has thus elaborated on oneiric rhetoric, with its own rules for
generating and for interpreting images. 
Symbol [141]
4.3.2.2. Metaphors and other tropes. Must we also exclude, from the rank
of properly called symbols, metaphors, allegories, and other tropes? This
is not to be taken for granted , because in many theories of literary criticism this distinction is not at all clear. However, even though they are
'open' to various interpretations, metaphors are always governed by
rhetorical rules and controlled by their co-texts.
In any case, there is a clear-cut test for disti nguishing a metaphor from
a symbol: a trope cannot be taken 'literally' without violating a pragmatic
maxim according to which a discourse is supposed to tell the truth; it
must be interpreted as a figure of speech, since otherwise it would appear senseless or blatantly false. On the contrary, the instances of the
symbolic mode do suggest a second sense, but could also be taken literally without jeopardizing the communicational intercourse. (I shall elaborate on this point in 4. 5.)
More evident is the coded nature of allegories. They can be interpreted according to complementary senses (see in 4.4. 3 the medieval
theory of the four senses of the Scriptures), but these senses are never
vague or indefinite.
A radical difference between symbol and allegory has been definitely
established by Romantic theorists, who have, however, dange rously
identified the symbolic with the aesthetic.
4·3·3· The Romantic symbol as an aesthetic text
Originally, a symbol was produced by the mutual relationship of two
pieces of a coin destined to acquire their full purport through their actual
or potential rejoining. In other sorts of signs, the signans becomes irrelevant at the moment at which its signatum is caught (the signans is thrown
away, so to speak); instead, in the signs that Romantic philosophers and
poets called symbols, the signatum acquires i ts full purport only insofar as
it is continually compared to the physical presence of its signans.
This idea suggests that there should be some resemblances between
symbolic activity and the aesthetic function of a language, where the
message is self-focusing and speaks mainly of itself or of the relation
between signans and signatum. The aesthetics of Romanticism has particularly insisted on this parenthood between symbolism and art. The
work of art is conceived as an absolutely coherent organism where expression. and content are inseparable. A work of art is thus an untranslatable and unspeakable message (its 'meaning' cannot be separated from
what conveys it), and art is symbolic by definition because its discourse
cannot be but undefi nable or infinitely definable. Schelling identifies
works of art with symbols because they are hypotyposes, self-presentations, and, instead of signifying an artistic idea, they are that idea in
themselves. There is no 'semantic' interpretation of a work of art.
Schelling distinguishes schemes, where the general provide us with 
[142] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
the understanding of the particular, from allegories, where the particular
provides us with the knowledge of the general; in the aesthetic symbols,
both procedures are at work simultaneously.
In the same line of thought, Goethe says that allegories designate directly, whereas symbols designate indirectly ( 1 797; 1 902 - 12:94). Allegories are transitive, whereas symbols are intransitive. Al legories speak
to the intelligence, whereas symbols speak to perception. Allegories are
arbitrary and conventional, whereas symbols are immediate and motivated. A symbol is an i mage which is natural and universally understandable. Allegories employ the particular as an example of the general;
symbols embody the general in the particular. Moreover, symbols are
polysemous, indefinitely interpretable; they realize the coincidence of
the contraries; they express the unexpressible, since their content excedes the capability of our reason:
Symbolisms transform the experience into an · idea, and an idea into an image, so that the idea expressed by the image remains always active and
unattainable and, even though expressed in all languages, remains unexpressible. Allegory transforms an experience into a concept and a concept
into an image, but so that the concept remains always defined and expressible by the image. (1809- 32; 1 926, n. 111 2 - 13)
In this sense the aesthetic and the symbolic come to definitely coincide,
but they define themselves with each other, in a circular way.
As a matter of fact, Romantic aesthetics does not explain the semiotic
strategy by which, in the poetic use of languages, particular meanings
are conveyed; it only describes the effect that a work of art can produce.
By doing so, Romantic aesthetics flattens the concept of semiosic interpretation (which undoubtedly acquires a particular status in aesthetic
texts) into the one of aesthetic enjoyment. On the other hand, semiotics
can explain the phenomenon of symbolic mode, but it cannot fully explain the aesthetic enjoyment, which depends on many extrasemiotic
elements. In a work of art, the expression is indefinitely interpretable,
because the interpreter can continually compare it with its content and
with the whole of his encyclopedic competence, but such a semiosic interpretation represents only one among the various aspects of aesthetic
openness. A work of art can be aesthetically interpreted in many ways,
because we compare its meanings (interpreted in the semiosic sense) with
the individual structu re of the token expression that conveys them. By
displaying further and further new and uncoded possible relationships
between these two planes, the work of art elicits also nonsemiosic reactions, such as synesthesiae, idiosyncratic associations, more and more
refined perceptions of the material texture of the conveying expression.
To inte rpret semiosically means to know better and better the 
Symbol [143]
possibilities of the encyclopedia; to interpret aesthetically also means to
know more and more intus et in cute the details of an individual object. In
Hjelmslev's terms, the semiosic interpre tation has to do with forms; the
aesthetic one has to do with substances. Thus if one uses the term symbol
to describe the aesthetic experience, one has then to avoid the same
term for other forms of 'symbolic' understanding, as, for instance, those
that take place in mystical experience (where the mystic gets something
beyond his own visionary experience).
The Romantic tradition is, instead , very ambiguous in this regard .
Influential theorists of symbolism such as Creuzer ( 1 810- 12) speak of
symbols as "epiphanies of the Sacred." The basic ideas of the established religious doctrines spring from symbols that act as a light beam
coming from the depths of the Being (ibid . , vol. 1, p. 35). However, the
same Creuzer says that a Greek sculpture is a plastic symbol , thus showing an oscillation between the idea of symbols as unattainable and transcendent revelations and symbols as the self-evident presence of the artistic value embodied in a physical form. Is the Romantic symbol the
instance of an immanence or of a transcendence.�
4·4· The symbolic mode
4·4· 1. The Hegelian symbol
A radical attempt to distinguish the symbolic experience from the aesthetic one was performed by Hegel ( 1 817) in his philosophy of the fine
arts.
The Hegelian symbol represents the first stage of artistic creativity
(which dialectically progresses from symbolic to classical and to romantic
art). "Generally speaking, symbol is some form of external existence
immediately present to the senses, which, however, is not accepted for
its own worth , as it lies before us in its immediacy, but for the wider and
more general significance which it offers to our reflection. We may consequently distinguish between two points of view equally applicable to
the term: first, the significance, and, second , the mode in which such a
significance is expressed. The first is a conception of the mind, or an
object which stands wholly indifferent to any particular conte nt; the
Iotter is a form of sensuous existence or a representation of some kind or
other" (ibid., vol. 2; Eng. tr. p. 8). In symbols the correlation between
signifier (expression) and signified (significance) is not a conventional
one (the lion is a symbol for strength because it is strong); nevertheless,
the motivation determining the correlation is in some way undetermined . The lion, for example, possesses qualities other than mere
strength , and these qualities do not become relevant to the symbolic 
[144] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
purpose . It is exactly this selection or reduction of the relevant qualities
that provides for the ambiguity of symbols. Hegel refuses the idea of
aesthetic symbolism as expressed by Creuzer: "In this sense the gods of
Greece, insofar, that is to say, as the art of Greece was able to represent
them as free, self-subsistent, and unique types of personality, are to be
accepted from no symbolical point of view, but as self-sufficient in their
own persons" (ibid ., p. 21). The symbolic mode arises as a form of
pre-art only when men look at natural objects as if they suggest something universal and essential, without a strict and absolute identity between expression and significance . In these first stages of the artistic
activity, when men try to spiritualize nature and to naturalize the universal, fantastic and confused results are produced; symbolic art experiences the inadequacy of its images and reacts to the sentiment of their
l imits by deforming them so to realize an excessive and merely quantitative "sublimity."
Hegel outlines carefully these phases of symbolic activity (unconscious
symbolism, symbolism of the sublime, conscious symbolism of the comparative type of art); through which mankind progresses from the symbols of Easte rn art and religion to Wes tern fables, parables, and
apologues, to the allegory, the metaphor, the simile and the didactic
poems. What is important, however, in Hegelian perspective, is the refusal to put together the symbolic and the artistic. The symbol always
displays a certain disproportion, a tension, an ambiguity, an analogical
precariousness. In "genuine symbolism," the forms do not signify themselves; rather, they "allude to," hint at a wider meaning. Any symbol is
an enigma, and " the Sphinx stands as a symbol for symbolism itself"
(ibid. , p. 83). In primeval symbolism a symbol has a meaning but it is
unable to express it completely. The meaning of a symbol will be fully
expressed only by the comparative mode of art, but at this point one is
witnessing the dialectic "death" of the symbolic mode which transforms
itself into higher and more mature forms of rhetorical expression.
Hegel's whole argument is extraordinarily lucid , at least in distinguishing
the symbolic from the aesthetic at large as well as from the rhetoric.
Hegel helps us in outlining a symbolic mode as a specific semiotic phenomenon in which a given expression is correlated to a content nebula (see
Eco 1 976, 3.6. 1 0).
442. Archetypes and the Sacred
jung's theory of symbols as archetypes clearly outlines a notion of the
symbolic mode as characterized by an analogy between expression and
content and by a fundamental vagueness of the expressed content.
Jung ( 1 934) opposes the personal unconscious to the collective one,
which represents a deeper, innate layer of human psyche and which has 
Symbol [ 145]
contents and modes of behavior that are more or less the same everywhere and in all individuals. The contents of the collective unconscious
are the archetypes, archaic types, universal images, representations collectives: lunar, solar, vegetal , metereological representations, more comprehensible in myths, more evident in dreams and visions. j ung is explicit in saying that these symbols are neither mere signs (he uses the
Greek technical word semefa) nor allegories. They are genuine symbols
precisely because they are ambiguous, full of half-glimpsed meanings,
and in the last resort i nexhaustible. They are paradoxical because they
are contradictory, just as for the alchemists the spirit was conceived as
senex at iuvenis simul, an old man and a youth at once. If the archetypes
are indescribable and infinitely interpretable, their experience cannot be
but amorphous, undetermined, and u narticulated. Symbols are empty
and full of meaning at the same time, and in this sense the experience of
the mystics, which is strictly concerned with symbolic visions, is a
paradoxical one. As also Scholem ( 1 960) remarks apropos of jewish mysticism, mystical thought lives on a continual threshold between tradi tion
and revolution: on one side the mystic is nourished by the tradition, but
on the other side the visions he has can be interpreted so to perturb the
traditional truths. Usually the mystic uses old symbols, but fills them up
with new senses and , in doing this, always challenges the authority, that
is, the thought of the tradition he is supposed to follow and to reinforce.
This kind of nihilistic experience is very well illustrated by the story of
Brother Klaus von der Flue , mentioned by j ung. Brother Klaus has the
vision of a mandala divided into six parts, within its center the "crowned
countenance of God." His experience was defi ned as "terrifying," and
the humanist Woelflin (fifteenth century) describes it by saying that "all
who came to him were filled with terror at the first glance." jung remarks that visions such as the mandala are the usual and traditional antidote for chaotic states of mind.
B rother Klaus has to choose between a free interpretation of the symbol and a traditional one. He relies on a devotional booklet by a German
mystic and assumes that what he has seen was the image of the Trinity.
In this way the mystic 'tamed' , so to speak, his unbearable experience:
This vision, undoubtedly fearful and highly perturbing, wh ich burst like a
volcano upon his religious view of the world, without any dogmatic prelude,
and without exegetical comment, naturally needed a long labor of assi milation in order ro fit it into the total structure of the psyche and thus resrore
the disturbed psychic balance . B rother Klaus came to terms with his experience on the basis of dogma, then firm as a rock, and the dogma proved his
powers of assimilation by turning something horribly alive into the beautiful
abstraction of the Trinity idea. But the reconciliation might have taken place
on a quite different basis provided by the vision i tself and its u nearthly 
[1 46] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
actuality - much to the disadvantage of the Christian conception of God and
no doubt to the still greater disadvantage of B rother Klaus himself, who
would then have become not a saint but a heretic (if not a lunatic). (Ju ng
1 934; Eng. tr. , p. 1 1 )
In the mystical experience, symbols must be tamed exactly because
they are exaggeratedly 'open' - and their force must be controlled . It
depends obviously on one's religious and philosophical beliefs to decide
whether this force springs from a Sacred Source, or is nothing other than
the way in which an interpreter, idiosyncratically, fills up the empty
container of the symbolic expression. Firth (1973) observes that the
mystical symbol is a private one; the mystic is the "detonator" of the
symbol, but immediately afterward a public "elaborator," who establishes certain collective and understandable meanings of the original
expression, is needed. In the story of B rother Klaus, both detonator and
elaborator coincided. Firth mentions, in contrast, the case of Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, who, as detonator, experiences the vision of the
Sacred Heart of Jesus, while her Jesuit confessor interprets and elaborates her symbolic material , providing the Catholic community with a
new cult.
Incidentally, the case of this vision is interesting insofar as the pertinence of the so-called analogous properties is concerned : Saint Margaret
Mary had her vision when both science and common opinion were definitely convinced that, physiologically speaking, the heart was not the
seat of human feelings; nevertheless, in the first half of this century,
Pope Pius XII still spoke of the Sacred Heart as a "natural symbol" of
the Divine Love. A symbol that was 'natural' only for those who, with an
u nconscious semiotic sensitivity, identified nature with encyclopedia.
Pius XII knew certainly that the human heart was not the seat of emotions, but he also knew that, according to a nonspecialized competence
(such as is expressed and supported by many ready-made syntagms and
by love songs), it still was considered so. What counts, in the symbolism
of the Sacred Heart, is not the weakness of the analogical correlation but
the vagueness of the correlated con tent. The content of the expression
/Sacred Heart/ (be it uttered by words or visually represented) is not a
series of theological propositions but an uncontrollable ensemble of mental and affective associations that every believer can project into the cardiac symbol . On the other hand , the symbol is the device by which a
given authority controls these associations, as well as the profound drives
that elicit them - in the same way in which the saint herself had probably projected into the mystical symbol a series of obsessions that, without the symbolic discipline, could have driven her to insanity.
But this is a positivist interpretation of a mystic experience. Usually, 
Symbol [147]
in the symbolic line of thought, symbols are considered as the vehicle of
a transcendent Voice who speaks through them. Such is the perspective
of Ricoeur's hermeneutics (1962). Symbols are opaque because they are
analogic; they are bound to the diversity of languages and cultures, and
their interpretation is always problematic: "There is no myth without
exegesis, no exegesis without confrontation ," but, if there are recognizable symbols, there must be a Truth that symbols express, and symbols
are the voices of Being: "The implicit philosophy of any phenomenology
of religion is the renewal of a theory of reminiscence" (1962 : 22). Ricoeur
knows very well that, along the Freudian line of thought, religious symbols do not speak of the Sacred but of what has been removed; but in his
hermeneutic perspective these two possibilities remain as complementary, and symbols can be interpreted in either way. They tell us about
the u nconscious that we were and the Sacred that we ought to become.
Freud and Heidegger are reread in a Hegelian mood. The eschatology of
hu man consciousness is a continual creative repetition of i ts archaeology.
In this way, naturally, nobody can assign to symbols a final truth or a
coded meaning.
443· The symbolic interpretation of the Holy Scriptures
The symbolic mode is a recurrent tendency in many cultures and can
coexist with other ways of producing or interpreting texts. Since it appears in many historical stages, it would be sufficient to isolate some of
its instantiations: one of its characteristics is to reproduce itself in different epochs with the same features, so that a historical survey need not
be exhaustive and can procede through examples.
We can start from one of the most influential instances of the symbolic
mode, the one developed by late Antiquity and the Middle Ages�- ;:,_c;
·
t
Only because it has represented one of the most impressive and longlasting cases of the symbolic mind, but also because our civilization is
still dependent in many respects on that historical experience.
Pagan poets believed, more or less, in the gods of which they were
speaking. But, since the century B.C. , Theagenes of Regium tried to
read these poets allegorically, and so did the Stoics many centuries afterward. This allegorical reading had secular pu rposes: it aimed at discovering some 'natural' truths beneath the mythical surface . However,
once this way of reading was outlined , why not turn the method , and its
purposes, the other way around ? Thus, while in the first century A.D.
Philo of Alexandria was still attempting a secular intepretation of the Old
Testament, Clement of Alexandria and Origenes attempted the opposite, that is, a nonsecular and, if possible, more mystical reading of religious texts. At the moment in which the newborn Christian theology
dared to speak of God, the Church Fathers realized that, in order to 
[148] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
speak of Him, they could only rely on what He had told them: the Holy
Scriptures.
The Holy Scriptures were two, the Old Testament and the New Testament. At that time the Gnostics assumed that only the New Testament
was true. Origenes wanted to keep the continuity between the two Testaments, but he had to decide in what way they were saying the same
thing, since apparently they were speaking differently. Thus he made
the decision of reading them in a parallel way: the Old Testament is the
signifier, or the 'letter' , of which the New Testament is the signified, or
the spirit. At the same time, the New Testament was also speaking of
something concerning the Incarnation, salvation, and moral duties. The
semiosic process was thus rather complicated: a first book speaking allegorically of the second one, and the second one speaking - sometimes
by parables, sometimes directly - of something else. Moreover, in this
beautiful case of unlimited semiosis, there was a curious identification
between sender, message as signifier or expression, and signified or content and referent, interpretandum, and interpretant - a puzzling web of
identities and differences that can be hardly represented by a bidimensional diagram such as in Figure 4.4. (For a splendid discussion on these
points, see Compagnon 1979).
Sender:
Christ,
as Logos
Content:
,. lnterpretants:
Referent:
Logoi, as the hermeneutic
discourses
Logos, Christ as the ultimate
referent of the Scriptures
FIGURE 4.4
This semiosic web was encouraged by the ambiguous status of the
term logos, which is at the same time verbum mentis and verbum vocis, as
well as the name and the nature of the second person of the Trinity.
Moreover, the first interpreter of the ancient law was still Christ as
Logos, and every commentary of the Holy Texts was an imitatio Christi, so
that in the light of the Logos all faithful interpreters can become Logikoi.
To make the web even more inextricable, Christ, insofar as He was the
Logos, that is, the knowledge that the Father had of Himself, was the
ensemble of all the divine archetypes; therefore he was fundamentally
polysemous. 
Symbol [149]
Thus both Tes taments speak of their sender and of their own
polysemous nature, and their content is the nebula of all the possible
archetypes.
What the first exegetes understood was that, at that point, the Scriptures were in the position of saying everything, and everything was too
much, for any exegesis looks for a translatable Truth. The Church is the
divine institution supposed to explai n the tru th, to make it understandable, even to the illiterate. The symbolic nature of the Books had thus
to be tamed and reduced, in the same way in which the mystic vision of
the detonator has to be tamed by its elaborator. The symbolic mode had
to be transformed into the allegorical one. The Scriptures potentially had
every possible meaning, but in fact their reading was susceptible to
being governed by a code, and the senses of the text had to be reduced
to a manageable format. That is why the first Fathers proposed the
theory of the allegorical senses. In the beginning the senses were three:
literal, moral or psychic, mystic or pneumatic. According to Origenes,'
the moral sense held also for the unfaithful and was thus immediately
dependent on the literal one. Later, the senses became four (literal,
allegorical, moral, and anagogical). As Dante explained in the EJi;t�la
XIII (but the theoiy is already fulfy elaborated by Bede in the seventh
century), given a verse such as in exitu Israel de Aegypto, "if we look at the
letter it means the exodus of the sons of Israel from Egypt at the time of
Moses; if we look to the allegory it means our redemption through
Christ; if we look at the moral sense it means the conversion of the soul
from the misery of sin to the state of grace; if we look at the mystical
sense it means the departure of the sanctified spirit from the servitude of
th is corruption to the freedom of eternal glory."
With this further elaboration, the moral sense can be understood only
through the mediation of the allegorical one, and is attainable only by
the faithful ones. The whole medieval tradition was elaborating upon
this theme, which can be summarized through the line of Nicholas of
Lyra: Littera gesta docet, quid credos a/legoria, mora/is quid agas, quo tendas
anagogia. (But the same formulation appears in many other authors; for
an impressive survey of all these theories, see De Lubac 1959. )
The theory of the four senses provided a sort of guarantee for the·
correct decoding of the Books. But the Patristic and Scholastic mind
could never avoid the feeling of the inexhaustible profundity of the
Scriptures, frequently compared to a forest or to an ocean. According to
Saint jerome they are an injinita sensuum sylva (Ep. 64.21) and an
"oceanum mysteriosum Dei, ut sic loquar labyrinthum" (In Gen. 9· 1).
Origenes speaks of a "latissima sylva" (In Ez. 4) o r o f a sea where, if we
enter with a small boat, our mind is caught by fear and we are submerged by its whirls (In Gen. 9. 1 ). 
[I SO] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
Gilbert of Stanford tries to show how many senses can be found in the
rapids of the divine discourse:
Scriptura Sacra, morem rapidissimi fl uminis tenens, sic hu manarum mentium profunda replet, ut semper exundet; sic hauricntes satiat, m· inhexausta permaneat. Profluunt ex ea spiritualium scnsuum gurgites abundantes, et transeuntibus aliis, alia surgunt: immo, non transeuntibus, quia
sapientia immortalis est; sed , emergentibus ct decorem suum ostendentibus
aliis, alii non deficientibus succedunt sed manentes subsequuntu r; ut unusquisque pro modo capacitatis suac in ea reperiat unde se copiose reficiat et
aliis undc sc fortiter excrcent derelinquat. (In Cant. 20. 225)
Which is to say that, even though the senses of the Scriptures are infinite, none of them annuls the others, each increasingly enriching this
immense storage of meanings, where everybody can find what he is able
to find according to his interpretive capabilities.
The metaphor of the ocean or of the forest alluded to the symbolic
structure of the Books, and this symbolic structure was the continual
challenge to their allegorical interpretability. Either the Books had infinite readings ( therefore they were ambiguous expression correlated to
the content nebula of all possible archetypes) or they had only the four
canonical ones. But, if the four senses were coded , there was no further
possibility of inte rpreting the Books, therefore of exploiting their admirable profundity. The problem was how to reconcile these two trends, so
that it was possible to read them, continually discovering in their pages,
if not new things, at least the same and everlasting truth rephrased in
ever new ways: non nova sed nove, no new things but the same things
increasingly retold in a new way.
· The early Christian theology had then to find a way of controlling (by
an allegorical code) the free interpretation of the (symbolic and uncoded)
nature of the Books. A rather oxymoric situation, indeed . At this point
the topological model able to represent this situation should be even
more complex (perhaps a Moebius' Ring), since the only authority that
could establish the right way of inte rpreting the Books was the Church,
founded upon the Tradition; but the Tradition was rep resented exactly
by the series of the 'good' interpretation of the Holy Scriptures. In other
words, the Tradition d raws its right to control the interpretation of the
Books from the interpretation of the Books. Quis custodiet custodes? How
can the authority legitimate the interpretation, since the authority itself
is legitimated by the interpretation?
This question had no answer; no theory of types or of metalanguage
was elaborated to legitimate the circle of hermeneutic legitimation (no
theory of hermeneutic legitimation can be indeed legitimate if not by
the very process of hermeneu tic reading). At the origins of the her-
Symbol [151]
meneutic practice, there is a circle; it does not matter how holy or how
VICIOUS.
The only possible answer to this question was a practical one: the
rules for good interpretation were provided by the gatekeepers of the
orthodoxy, and the gatekeepers of the orthodoxy were the winners (in
terms of political and cultural power) of the struggle to impose their own
interpretation. Such a rule also holds for a more secular hermeneutics:
the text will tell the truth insofar as the reader has the rhetorical power
to make it speak. And the reader will be sure to have seen right insofar
as he has seen - in the text - his own image. The same, albeit less secular, procedure held for the interpretive practice in the jewish mysticism:
"The literal meaning is preserved, but merely as the gate through which
the mystic passes, a gate, however, which he opens up to himself over
and over again. The Zohar expresses this attitude of the mystic very
succinctly when, in a memorable exegesis of Genesis 12: 12., God's
words to Abraham , Lekh lekha, are taken not only in their literal meaning,
'Get thee out' , that is, they are not interpreted as referring only to God's
command to Abraham to go out into the world, but are also. read with
mystical literalness as 'Go to thee' , that is, to thine own self" (Scholem
1 960; E ng. tr. , p. 15). We feel here, preechoed , the Freudian maxim, as
reread by Lacan: Jllo Es war, sol/ lch werden.
The whole history of medieval exegesis is the story of the establishing
and, at the same time, of the fair challenging of exegetical auctoritates.
First of all, and from the time of Augustine, it was discovered that, if the
Books always tell something Other, they do it not only by the words they
use but also through the facts they tell about. The allegory is not only in
verbis but also in factis. The problem was how to assign an allegorical
value to facts, that is, to the furniture of the existing world, to animals,
to plants, to stones, to actions, to gestures, and so on. In De Doctrina
Christiana Augustine decides that, in order to understand the Scriptures,
the exegete must know physics, geography, botany, mineralogy. Thus
the new Christian civilization accepts and introduces (by further and
further reelaborations) into the interpretive circle, that is, into its own
growing encyclopedia, all the knowledge of classic civilization, as it was
inherited by the late Roman culture, under the form of a syncretistic
encyclopedia. This is the origin of the acceptance of the Hellenistic
Physio/ogus and of the successive prod uction of herbaries, bestiaries,
lapidaries, Imagines, and Specula Mundi.
The main characteristics of these texts are the following: (a) Since
every visible entity has an allegorical meaning, the world creatures are
not described according to their empirical properties, but according to
those properties that display some analogy with the content they are
supposed to represent. So the lion is described as an animal which can-
[1 52] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
eels with its tail the traces of its passage in order to deceive its hunters,
simply because he must possess this property to function as the image of
Christ deleting the traces of human sin by His incarnation. (b) Whether
because of the growth of a hall ucinatory imagination or because of a
symbolic temptation challenging the rights of the allegorical coding, the
properties of these creatures are frequently contradictory, so that every
item of the medieval encyclopedia can acquire alternative meanings: the
lion is at the same time the figure of Christ and the figu re of the Devil
because of its hideous jaws. How can an interpreter be sure that in a
given context the lion stands for Christ and not for the Devil? The allegorical code is open, so as to become a symbolic matrix where the
meanings are, if not nebulous, at least manifold. The medieval solution
is that a preceding auctoritas should have already established the 'good'
contextual selections: once again the vicious hermeneutic circle. The
medieval interpreter looks continually for good authorities, knowing at
the same time that any authority has a wax nose that can be moulded as
the interpreter wants. With humble and hypocrital flexibility, the
medieval interpreter knows that he is a dwarf in res pect to the
auctoritates, but a dwarf mounted upon the shoulders of giants, and
therefore is able to look a little further ahead : perhaps he does not see
new things (nova}, but he sees them in a new way (nove).
In this way the allegorical mode is inextricably and ambiguously intertwined with the symbolic one: the medieval mind is a divided one,
rent by the confl ict between confidence in an indisputable truth (repeated by every word and every fact) and the feeling that words and
facts must be continually reinterpreted in order to go further and further,
beyond their acknowledged sense, since the whole universe is quasi fiber
scriptus digito Dei, but in this book aliud dicitur, aliud demonstratur.
Once again, as in the case of mysticism, the gatheri ng of the community around the ever speaking voices of the Scriptures and of the world,
has a function of social control. It does not matter what both the Book
and the world say; it matters that they speak and that there is a center of
elaboration of their speech. When people gather around a flag, it does
not matter what exactly the flag symbolically means, since it can have
multiple senses; what matters is that the flag undoubtedly means something to them. The power consists in possessing the key for the right interpretation or (which is the same) in being acknowledged by the community as the one who possesses the key. Not only in the Middle Ages
does every community (be it a church, a country, a political regime, a
scientific school) in which the symbolic mode holds need an auctoritas
(the Pope, the Big Brother, the Master). The auctoritas is indispensable
when there is not a code; where there is a code - as a system of preestablished rules - there is no need for a central auctoritas, and the power 
Symbol [153]
is distributed through the nodes of organized competence. Either power
elimi nates the other one. Civilizations and cultural groups have to make
a choice .
The medieval symbolic mode collapses when, with the theology of
Aquinas, a code wins (the Summae are a sort of institutional code; they
do not allow for a vague interpretation of the reality and of the Scriptures). Aqu inas definite ly destroys with cogent argumentations the
medieval tendency to the allegorical and symbolic reading of the reality
and reserves a strictly coded allegorical reading only for the facts narrated
by the Old Testament.
The language of the Scriptures is purely literal: the Old Testament
tells us about facts that, insofar as they have been predisposed by God in
order to teach us, are to be interpreted allegorically. But these facts are
only the facts narrated by the Old Testament. After the Incarnation the
possibility of looking at facts as meaning something else no longer exists.
As far as language ( be it poetic or scriptural) is concerned , every
rhetorical strategy represents an instance of modus parabolicus, but this
non supergreditur modum litterale (Quodlibetales 8. 6. 1 6.ob I, ad I). This
means that, since there are rhetorical rules, tropes and allegories can be
interpreted univocally as if they were literal expressions. Rhetoric is a
natural language.
If the symbolic mode collapses, for a while, in Western th rought, it,
however, survives and grows in different directions in other forms of
mysticism. A paramount example of a different symbolic mode is the
jewish mysticism of the Kabala, where the Book, which the Christian
tradition tried desperately to anchor to a fixed allegorical reading, blows
up, so to speak, in a really unlimited semiosis, even losing the linear
consistency of its material expressive level.
4·44 The Kabalistic drift
Scholem (1960) says that jewish mystics have always tried to project
their own thought into the biblical texts; as a matter of fact, every unexpressible reading of a symbolic machinery depends on such a projective attitude. In the reading of the Holy Text according to the symbolic
mode, "letters and names are not conventional means of communication. They are far more. Each one of them represents a concentration of
energy and expresses a wealth of meaning which cannot be translated , or
not fully at least, into human language" ( 1 960; Eng. tr. , p. 36). For the
Kabalist, the fact that God expresses Himself, even though His utterances are beyond any human insight, is more important than any specific
and coded meaning His words can convey.
The Zohar says that "in any word shine a thousand lights" (3. 202a).
The unlimitedness of the sense of a text is due to the free combinations 
[ 1 54] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
of its signifiers , which in that text are linked together as they are only
accidentally but which could be combined differently. In a manuscript of
Rabbi Eli-yaku Kohen lttamari of Smyrna, we read why the scrolls of the
Torah, according to Rabbinic law, must be written without vowels and
punctuation :
This is a reference to the state of the Torah as it existed in the sight of God
before it was transmitted to the lower spheres. For He had before Him
numerous letters that were not printed into words as is the case today, because the actual arrangement of the words would depend on the way in
which this lower world conducted itself. ... The divine purpose will be
revealed in the 'lbrah at the coming of the Messiah, who will engulf death
forever .... For the God will annul the present combination of letters that
form the words of our present Torah and will compose the letters into other
words, which will form new septences, speaking of other things. (Scholem
1 960; Eng. tr. , pp. 74- 75)
Thus, when a man utters the words of the Torah, he hever ceases to
create spiritual potencies and new lights: "If therefore he spends the
whole day reading just this one verse, he attains eternal beatitude, for at
all times, indeed, in every moment, the composition [of the inner linguistic elements] changes in accordance with the names that flare up
within him at this moment" (ibid., p. 76). Such a disposition to interrogate a text according to a symbolic mode still rules many contemporary
hermeneutic practices. They can take two alte rnative ( though profoundly connected at their source) routes. Language can be the place
where things come authentically to begin: in Heidegger's hermeneutics
the word is not 'sign' (Zeichen ) but 'to show' (Zeigen ), and what is shown
is the true voice of Bei ng. In such a line of throught, texts can be indefinitely questioned, but they do not speak only of themselves; they reveal something else and something more.
On the other hand, there is a radically secularized hermeneutics where
the text is no longer transparent and symptomatic, since it only speaks of
its possibility of eliciting a semiosic 'drift' . More than 'auscultate' , the
text must be (with a more radically Kabalistic option) deconstructed, until
fracturing its own expressive texture. Thus the text does not speak any
longer of its own 'outside' ; it does not even speak of i tself; it speaks of
our own experience in reading (deconstructively) it. There is no more a
dialectics of here and there, of signans and signatum. E verything happens
here - and the dialectics takes place, at most, as a further-and-further
movement, from signans to signans.
Only in this way, even in epistemological frameworks devoid of a traditional notion of truth, is it possible that the very act of reading provide
a certain approach to what a text truly (even though never definitely) 
Symbol [ 1 55]
says. From this point of view, it is interesting to reread the fascinating
discussion that took place between John Searle (unwillingly playing the
role of the 'lite ral' man, who believed that the word copyright conventionally means that the excerpt of a given paper cannot be reproduced without permission) and Jacques Derrida who, in a true kabalistic
mood, from the u nstable combination copyright d raws infinite inferences
on the instability and fragility of Searle's language and on the deconstructibility of every linguistic utterance. Focused as a new and unfaithful Torah, the text of Searle allows Derrida to read in it something else,
other than what his adversary believed it to mean, and by and through
which he in fact has been meant:
The questioning initiated by the logic and the graphics of Sec does not stop
at the security of the code, nor at its concept. I cannot pursue this problem
too far, since that would only add new complications to a discussion that is
already too slow, overdetermined, and overcoded in all respects. I shall
simply observe that this line of questioning is opened in the first of Sec's
three parts, and to be exact by the following phrase: "The perhaps paradoxical consequence of my here having recourse to ite ration and to code: the
disruption, in the last analysis, of the authority of the code as a finite system
of rules, at the same time, the radical destruction of any con text as the
protocol of code" (p. 1 80). The same direction, that of an iterability that can
only be what it is in the impurity of its self-identity (repetition altering and
alteration identifying), is charted by the following propositions: "As far as
the internal semiotic context is concerned, the force of the rupture is no less
important: by vinue of its essential i terability, a written syntagm can always
be detached from the chain in which it is inserted or given without causing
it to lose all possibility of functioning, if not all possibility of 'communicating' , precisely. One can perhaps come to recognize other possibilities in it
by inscribing it or grafting it onto other chains. No context can entirely
enclose it. Nor any code, the code here being both the possibility and impossibility of wri ting, of its essential iterability ( repetition/alterity)" (p.
1 82). And: " ... in so doing [i.e. , by the iterability or the citationality that it
permits] it [the sign] can break with every given context, engendering an
infinity of new con texts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This
does not imply that the mark is valid oU£side of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchoring
[ancroge]" (pp. 1 85 - 6). ( De rrida 1 977: 203 - 4)
In this ultimate epiphany of the symbolic mode, the text as symbol is
no longer read in order to find in it a truth that lies outside: the only truth
( that is, the old Kabalistic God) is the very play of deconstruction. The
ultimate truth is that the text is a mere play of differences and displacements. Rabbi Levi Isaac said that "also the white, the spaces in the
scroll of the Torah, consist of letters, only that we are not able to read 
[ 1 56] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
them as we read black letters . But, in the Messianic Age, God will also
reveal to us the white of the Torah, whose letters have become invisible
to us, and that is what is meant by the statement about the 'new Torah' "
(Scholem 1 960; E ng. tr. , p. 82). The Lacanian acknowledgment of the
autonomy of the symbolic as the chain of the signifiers, by inspiring the
new deconstructionist practices, has now allowed the new and atheistic
mystics of the godless drift, to rewrite indefinitely, at every new reading,
the new Torah.
4·5· Semiotics of the symbolic mode
Our quest for the specific symbolic mode is seriously challenged by the
deconstructive practice. If in a text everything can be read beyond its
conventional (and delusory) meaning, then every text is a reserve of symbols. Once again, the symbolic mode is equated with the semiotic one:
each human discourse always speaks indirectly. A fascinating but unsatisfactory concl usion. Symbols looked so mysterious, they promised
such a privileged way of knowing, and now we are left with two equally
irritating alternatives: either every utterance provides for this privileged
knowledge (but where everything is privileged, there is no longer a
privilege) or language is always symbolic but only a happy few can deal
with it as such. It will be then unclear what the others really understand;
they probably misunderstand, but why despise them, since misunderstanding is the only way of interpreting? Or is there a difference between
'correct' and 'incorrect' misunderstanding?
There is, however, a fully secularized way of conceiving of the symbolic mode, as limited to specific forms of communication, and it is the
one proposed by many modern aesthetic theories springing from the experience of French Symbolism. Even though the cultural roots of artists
such as Baudelaire go back to many currents of mystical throught, in the
modern aesthetic perspective the artist is a free detonator of a vision that
he himself prod uces: an expression purposefully endowed with vague
meanings and that cannot be anchored to a preestablished code (there is
no fixed elaboration). The poetic work remains open. It is still the
Romantic ideal, but definitely dominated by the ideal of poetic ambiguity. It is true that when Baudelaire (in "Correspondances" ) speaks
of Nature as a temple whose living pillars whisper a cryptic speech, so
that man wanders among them as in a wood of symbols where colors,
perfumes, and sounds echo each other, this picture reminds us of the
medieval world as a book written by the hand of God. But Baudelairean
symbols (be they albatrosses, cats, or serpents) are private; they do not
need a Physiologus to explain their possible meanings. They acquire their
full significance only within their poetic context. It is true that Mal-
Symbol [ 1 57]
larm6's idea of a context made up by empty and white spaces can recall
the rabbinic idea of a scroll where even the white spaces are to be read
as letters - but this time there is no God to warrant (and to be named
by) the combinatory game: the Book is not conceived by God to speak of
Himself; on the contrary, it is the whole world which exists in order to
give birth to the Book (Le Livre), and the Book only speaks of its infinite
combinatorial possibilities.
More radically, the symbolic mode is poetically secularized in Joyce's
theory of epiphanies and in E liot's notion of objective correlative. Here
events, gestures, things suddenly appear as a strange, inexplicable, intrusive evidence within a context which is too weak to j ustify their presence . So they reveal that they are there to reveal something else; it is up
to the reader to decide what else.
In this line of thought, not everything can be a symbol. A symbol has to
be textually p roduced; it requires a specific semiotic strategy. It is
exactly such a strategy that should now be in some way outlined - at
least under the form of an abstract model. A symbolic strategy can produce aesthetic enjoyment, but it is first of all semiotic machinery.
Let us start from the normal conversational implicatures as described
by Grice (1967). They are instances of indirect signification (see 4. 2.2
above), but not necessarily of the symbolic mode: the additional meaning transmitted by an implicatu re is not a vague one, at least as far as the
intentions of the speaker are concerned (it can become vague only because of a lack of cooperation by the hearer).
In a text, the device of flouting the conversational maxims can be
used rhetorically. Metaphors, irony, hyperboles violate the maxim of
quality, since they do not tell (literally) the truth. If I say that a hero is a
lion, literally speaking I lie; my addressee, by recognizing such a blatant
case of lying, must infer that I probably intend to say something else.
But, since the correct interpretation of the metaphor is that this hero is a
courageous or ferocious man, the metaphorical expression does not necessarily convey a content nebula (even though it could). Many metaphors (and all catachreses) can be disambiguated without vagueness.
More interesting are the violations of the maxims of quantity, relation,
and manner. Not every rhetorical violation of these maxims produces the
symbolic mode: figure� such as periphrasis or laconism violate the maxim
of quantity without conveying vague meanings, and certain synecdoches
and metonymies violate the maxim of manner without referri ng to
nebulous contents .
Nevertheless, we can say that, even though not all the violations of
these maxims result in producing the symbolic mode, the symbolic
mode springs from certain violations of them and represents a case of
textual implicature. 
[ 1 58] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
Naturally, a text can narrate a case of conversational implicature, thus
encouraging the interpreter to implement the appropriate inferences. If a
narrative text reports a conversation in which the first speaker asks the
second one about his love affairs, and the second speaker answers by
some meteorological remarks, the reader has to infer that the second
speaker was making a conversational implicature, meaning "I am not
supposed to tell you about my private life," and , by means of other
co-textual inference, some additional information about this character
can be extrapolated . But all these inferences follow rhetorical or psychological laws, more or less coded, and rely on preestablished frames. This
will not be considered an instance of textual implicature but, rather, a
case of mere reported conversational implicature.
On the contrary, when in a Zen story the Master, asked about the
meaning of life, answers by raising his stick, the interpreter smells an
abnormal i mplicature, whose interpretant keys lie outside preexisting
frames. This gesture means not only that the Master refuses to answer
but also that his (gestural) answer has a still uncoded meaning, and
maybe more than one. The textual implicature signaling the appearance
of the symbolic mode depends on the presentation of a sentence, of a
word, of an object, of an action that, according to the precoded narrative
or discurs ive frames, to the acknowledged rhetorical rules, to the most
common linguistic usages, should not have the relevance it acquires
within that context.
The standard reaction to the instantiation of the symbolic mode
should be a sort of u neasiness felt by the interpre ter when witnessing an
inexplicable move on the part of the text, the sentiment that a certain
word , sentence , fact, or object should not have been introduced in the
discourse or at least not have acquired such an i mportance. The interpreter feels a surplus of signification since he guesses that the maxims of
relevance, manner, or quantity have not been violated by chance or by
mistake. On the contra ry, they a re not only flouted , but - so to
speak - flouted dramatically.
"By an epiphany [Stephen] meant a sudden spiri tual manifestation,
whether in the vulgarity of speech or of gesture or in a memorable phase
of the mind i tself. He believed that it was for the man of letters to
record these epiphanies with extreme care, seeing that they themselves
are the most delicate and evanescent of moments" (Stephen Hero ). In producing most of his epiphanies, Joyce puts them within a co-text that
explicitly introduces and stresses their strangeness and their revealing
intrusiveness. Other authors - see, for example, the objective correlatives in E liot - present the irrelevant apparitions without justifying their
presence. What signals their role is the fact that they should not be there.
Incidentally, the feeling that something should not be there is the one
that accompanies, in the early theory of textual symbolism, the interpre-
Symbol [ 1 59]
tation of an event, of an object, of a precept in the Holy Scriptures. See
how Augustine, in the Doctrina Christiana, explains when an expression
of the Bible has to be taken figuratively and not literally (naturally, as we
have seen in 4.4. 3, the problem of Augustine and of the Middle Ages
will be to reduce the symbolic power of the expression by interpreting it
allegorically):
To this warning that we must beware not to take figurative or transferred
expressions as though they were literal, a further warning must be added
lest we wish to take literal expressions as though they were figurative.
Therefore a method of determining whether a locution is literal or figurative
must be established . And generally this method consists in this: that whatever appears in the divine Word that does not literally pertain to virtuous
behavior or to the truth of fai th you must take to be figurative . (3. 14; Eng.
tr. D. W. Robertson, On Christian Doctrine [Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill,
1 9771 p. 87)
The symbolic mode, as theorized by Decadent and contemporary aesthetics has also been, and can also be, implemented in different cultural
frameworks. In Gerard de Nerval's Sylvie, the narrator, in the first chapter, lives a conflict between his actual love for an actress (seen as an
unattai nable ideal woman) and the crude everyday reality. A piece of
news read by chance plunges him (at the beginning of the second chapter) into a state of half-sleep, in which he recollects the events of an
imprecise past - presu mably his childhood , in the village of Loisy. The
temporal contours of this reverie are blurred and misty: he remembers
the apparition of a mysterious and ethereal beauty, Adrienne, destined
for the convent.
In the third chapter, when awakening from his state of half-sleep, the
narrator compares the image of Adrienne with the actress and is caught
by the suspicion that they are the same person, an unreasonable hypothesis, i ndeed, but he still suspects having overlapped the two images,
loving the disappeared girl of his childhood in the shape of the actress of
his adult age. Sud denly, he decides to set foot into reality again. Incidentally, at this point the narration abruptedly shifts to the present
tense; previously it had been carried on by the imperfect (a tense that in
French stresses the intemporal vagueness much more than the supposedly equivalent E nglish tenses can do). Returning to the reality, the
narrator decides to go back to Loisy, not to see the girl of his dreams,
but to see Sylvie, who in the second chapter appeared as the representative of the humble reality as opposed to the enchanted Adrienne. He
wonders what time it can be, realizing that he has no watch. He steps
back to ask the doorman, and with this concrete information he takes a
cab to go back in space and, ideally, in time.
However, between the first question about the right time and his visit 
[160] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
to the concierge, the narrative sequence is interrupted by the following
description:
Among all the bric-a-brac splendours which it was cutomary to collect at that
period to give local colour to an old apartment, shone the restored brilliance
of one of those Renaissance clocks, whose gilded dome surmoun ted by the
figure of Time is supported by caratides in the Medici style, resting in their
tu rn on semi-plunging horses. The historical Diana, with her arm rou nd her
stag, is in low relief on the face, where the enamelled numbers of the hours
are marked on an inlaid background. The works, excellent no doubt, had
not been wound up for two centuries. I had not bought that clock in
Touraine to learn the time from it. (Nerval 1 853; E ng. tr. , pp. So - 81)
What is the narrative function of this description? None. The reader
already knows that the narrator had no reliable watch. At the discursive
level, this long digression does not add m uch to the knowledge of the
habits of the character. The presence of that clock sounds strange and
strangely delays the action. Thus the clock must be there to mean something else.
What it could mean will be inferred throughout the further cou rse of
the story. In the fourth chapter, Nerval does not narrate the present trip
to Loisy. Just at the end of the third chapter, the author abandons the
narrator sitting in the cab and follows his new memories. The narrator
muses on another time, different from the one of the second chapter. It
is some tem poral state between the remote childhood and the time of
the narration, an imprecise moment of the narrator's adolescence , which
lasts from chapter four until chapter six. At the beginning of the seventh
chapter, there is a very short return to the present (time and tense); then
the narrator starts a new reverie about a bewitched voyage to the Abbey
of Chaalis - where he believes he saw Adrienne for a second time. The
temporal contours of this experience are absolutely gloomy: was he there
before or after the experiences remembered in the previous three chapters? Moreover, did he really meet Adrienne, or was it a hallucination?
This chapter is a revealing clue that impels the reader to consider the
following, as well as the preceding, chapters in the light of an unsuccessful quest for the things of the past. Nerval is not Proust; he does not
come to terms with his past. Sylvie is the story of the failure of memory
as well as of the failure of identity: the narrator is unable to distinguish
not only the present from the bygone times but also the imaginary from
the real. Sylvie, Adrienne, and the actress are three 'actorial' embodiments of the same octant - each woman becoming in her turn the instance of a forgotten and lost ideal, as opposed to the crude presence (or
absence and death) of the others. The narrator fails to understand which
one he really loves and which one he really loved. At this point the 
Symbol [161]
reader catches the possible symbolic meanings of the Renaissance clock.
It was a symbol standing for a nebula of alternative and nevertheless
complementary contents, namely, the vagueness of remembrance, the
incumbence of the past, the transiency of time, the longing for the remnants of an idealized heroic era - perhaps the clock is the symbol for
Sylvie as a whole, a story within a story - and so on in infinitum. The
novel encourages as many interpretations as there are readings. This
symbol is open ; it is, however, overdetermined by the co-text. It is
undoubtedly a symbol, since its interpretation is doubtful, and there were
only doubtful reasons for its textual appearance.
The episode is interpreted as symbolic exactly insofar as it cannot be
definitely interpreted. The content of the symbol is a nebula of possible
interpretations; open to a semiosic displacement from interpretant to interpretant, the symbol has no authorized interpretant. The symbol says
that there is something that it could say, but this something cannot be
definitely spelled out once and for all; otherwise the symbol would stop
saying it. The symbol says clearly only that it is a semiotic machine
devised to function according to the symbolic mode.
In this sense, a symbol is different from a metaphor. When facing a
metaphor, the interpreter, in discovering that the metaphoric expression
does not tell the truth, is obliged to interpret it metaphorically. In the
same way, when facing the flou ting of a conversational maxim, one is
obliged to assu me that the expression should express something else.
On the contrary, when meeting an allegory, the interpreter could also
decide to interpret it in its literal sense. The fact that, at the beginning
of the Divine Comedy, Dante is in a gloomy wood can be taken as a report
of a literal event, disregarding the possibility of seeing it as the adventure of a human soul lost in the wood of sin.
Both symbol and allegory are signaled , at least, by a feeling of literal
waste, by the suspicion that spending such a textual energy for saying
only this, is pragmatically 'uneconomic' .
The further difference between sym bol and allegory stands in this:
that the allegory is more insisted upon than the symbol and , furthermore, that the allegory is a piece of extended narrativity, whereas usually a symbol is the sudden apparition of something that disturbs the
course of a previous narration. Moreover, an allegory should immediately
suggest its own key; it should point toward a portion of encyclopedia
which already hosts the right frames for interpreting it (it represents an
explicit intertextual reminder), whereas a symbol leaves the interpreter
face to face with the uncoded . Thus a sym bol cannot send back to a
previously coded cultural competence; it is idiolectal because it holds
only for the textual environment where it appears (otherwise it is only
the 'quotation' of a previously catachresized symbol). In this sense, aes-
[162] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
thetic symbols are subtracted from every 'political' control; they detonate,
but they cannot be elaborated from the outside. The aesthetic experience
cannot by a mystical one, because it cannot be interpreted and tamed by
an external authority. No critical achievement has the force to establish
an interpretive tradition; when this happens, the aesthetic symbol has
provisionally ( perhaps definitely) lost its appeal - it has become something that can be quoted as 'shibboleth' by the members of a critical
clique, the 'gesture' of a frozen ritual, the mere mention of a previous
symbolic experience . The living symbol is then substituted with a
Kitsch label.
4.6. Conclusions
If one then makes an abstrac tion fro m any possible u n derlying
metaphysics or mystical assumption, the symbol is not a particular sort of
sign, endowed with mysterious qualities, nor is it a particular modality of
sign p roduction. It is a textual modality, a way of producing and of interpreting the aspects of a text. According to a typology of sign production
(see Eco 1 976, 3.6) there is an actualization of the sym bolic mode when,
through a process of invention, a textual element which could be interpreted as a mere imprint, or a replica, or a stylization is produced. But it
can also be identified, by a sudden process of recognition, as the
projection, by ratio difficilis, of a content nebula.
Put the wheel of a carriage at the door of a country house. It can be the
sign for the workshop of a carriage maker (and in this sense it is an example
of the whole class of object there produced); it can be the sign for a
restaurant { thus being a sample, pars pro toto, of that rural world of which it
announces and promises the culinary delights); it can be the stylization of a
stylization for the local seat of the Rotary Club. One can also decide to
recognize it as a manifestation of the symbolic mode: one can focus its
circularity as suggesting the ability of proceding ad infinitum, the equal
distance of the hub from every point of the circle, the radiant symmetry
that links the hub to the rim through i ts spokes .... One can disregard as
symbolically irrelevant other properties (namely, its wooden material, its
artificial origin, its metonymic link to oxen and horses ... ). Starting from
the selected properties, one can discover, in one's encyclopedic competence, that these pertinent properties map the properties of something
else, even though this something else is a nebula of many things, let us
say, time with its forward progress, the perfect symmetry of God , the
creative energy that produces from a unique center the circular perfection
of every being, the progression of the divine lightbeams throughout the
fall of Neoplatonic emanations. . . . That wheel can send us back to all
these properties of all these entities, and in its content nebula it conveys 
Symbol [163]
all of them, and all of them can coexist at the same time, irrespective of
their mutual contradictoriness. The symbolic mode neither cancels the
wheel as a physical presence (all the suggested content seems to live
within the wheel and because of the wheel) nor cancels the token wheel as a
vehicle of a 'literal' conventionalized meaning. For the profane it could
still remain the sign for the carriage maker's workshop. In the same way,
the profane only sees a cobbler at work where the Kabalist recognizes in
his operation the symbolic action of who "at every stitch of his awl ...
not only joined the upper leather with the sole, but all the upper things
with all lower things ," drawing at every step "the steam of emanation
down from the upper to the lower (so transforming profane action into
ritual action), until he himself was transfigured from the earthly E noch
into the transcendent Metatron, who had been the obj ect of his meditation" (Scholem 1 960; E ng. tr. , p. 1 32).
The symbolic mode is thus not only a mode of producing a text, but
also a mode for interpreting every text - through a pragmatic decision:
"I want to interpret this text symbolically." It is a modality of textual
use.
This pragmatic decision produces at the semantic level a new signfunction, by associating new content - so far as it is possible, undetermined and vague - to expression already correlated to a coded content.
The main characteristic of the symbolic mode is that the text, when this
mode is not realized interpre tively, remains endowed with sense - at its
literal or figurative level.
In the mystical experience, the symbolic contents are in some way
suggested by a preceding tradition, and the interpreter is convinced (he
must be convinced) that they are not cultural unit but referents, aspects of
an extrasu bjective and extracultural reality.
In the modern aesthetic experience , the possible conten ts are
suggested by the co-text and by the intertextual tradition: the interpreter
knows that he is not discovering an external tru th but that, rather, he
makes the encyclopedia work at its best. Modern poetic symbolism is a
secularized symbolism where languages speak about their possibilities.
In any case, behind every strategy of the symbolic mode, be it religious
or aesthetic , there is a legitimating theology, even though it is the
atheistic theology of unlimited semiosis or of hermeneutics as deconstruction. A positive way to approach every instance of the symbolic
mode would be to ask: which theology legitimates it? 
5.1. The rise of a new category
5.1.1. A metaphor?
[5]
CODE
In the second half of this century, semiotics and related disciplines have
largely diffused the usage of the term code. The meaning of this term
seems to have become exaggeratedly generous, covering many semantic
areas, at least all those that philosophers of language would label as linguistics competence, a language, a system of rules, world knowledge or
encyclopedic competence , a set of pragmatic norms, and so on; as everyone realizes, these areas, albeit frequently overlapping each other, are by
no means co-extensive.
The notion of encyclopedia has been proposed in order to explain how
signs work according to an inferential model and in what way their meaning can be interpreted as a set of co-textually oriented instructions. If
one now compares such a flexible notion with the one of code, such as it
has been worked out in the first linguistic, semiotic, anthropological
writings of the 1 950s and 1 960s, one wonders whether these two notions
still have something in common.
The idea of encyclopedia attempts to take into account a process of
interpretation which takes the form of an inference (p :J q), whereas
codes, according to common opinion , are sets of point-to-point equivalences (p = q).
It would be sufficient to assume that the concept of encyclopedia improves and better articulates the 'old' concept of code, so that it would
be advisable to get rid of such an outdated category. However, if it is
wise to try new coinages when a concept becomes more elaborate and
more comprehensive, it is always imprudent to dispose of the old ones
[ 1 64] 
Code [165]
without exploring, along with their history, the reasons for which they
e nj oyed co nsensus and populari ty, as well as their perhaps still
undiscovered fruitfulness. We can easily start from the assumption that,
as it appeared and as it was so voraciously employed, the expression code
is a mere metaphor. But as it is shown in Chapter 3, metaphors reveal
the underlying structure of an encyclopedia; that is, they show (when
interpreted) many 'family resemblances' among different concepts. Thus
they should never be discarded as merely 'poetic' devices. To u nderstand why they have been coined will reveal what they aimed at suggesting. What was suggested is never an idiosyncratic connection; it has
something to do with the semantic interconnections provided by a given
historical encyclopedia.
5.1.2. Dictionaries
Until the second half of this centu ry, code was used as dictionaries
suggest, that is, in three senses: paleographic, institutional, and correlational.
The paleographic sense provides a clue for understanding the other two:
the codex was in Latin the stock or the stem of a tree from which wooden
writing tablets, smeared over with wax, were made; thus the term came
to designate parchement or paper books. Thus a code is something
which tells something else; it has had to do with communication or
signification since its most remote origins.
There is a book and a communicational purpose in correlational codes:
the Morse code is a code book or a dictionary which provides a set of
correlations between a series or a system of electric signals (written down
as dots and dashes) and a series of alphabetic letters. As we shall see,
speaking of the difference between ciphers and cloaks, there are codes
correlating expressions to expressions and codes correlating expressions
to contents.
Also, institutional codes are books, insofar as they are a "systematic collection of statu tes, a body of laws arranged as to avoid inconsistency and
overlapping ... a set of rules of any subject," and in this sense also "the
prevalent morality of a society or class" (Oxford English Dictionary). Legal
codes, codes of etiquette, chivalric codes, and so on, are systems of instructions.
At first glance, correlational codes seem to obey the equivalence
model, whereas institu tional codes seem to obey the inferential one.
The difference is not, however, so clear-cut. For instance, the Roman
Law (as opposed to the Anglo-Saxon Common Law, which is rather a
body of examples endowed with instructional or implicative power) looks
like a system of correlations: the Italian Codice Penale (penal law code)
does not say explicitly that murder is bad and does not forbid it as such 
[166] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
but, rather, correlates various forms of homicide with various forms of
punishment. On the other hand, the Italian Codice Civile (civil law
code) is a set of directions as to how one should act, and at the same
time a set of sanctions correlated with violations of the norm.
Our question is, however, the following: did the notion of code, such
as it appeared in the structuralistic milieu in the mid-century have something to do with one or more of the notions above? And why?
5.2. The landslide effect
Saussure speaks vaguely (in Cours de linguistique genera/e) of le code de Ia
langue. The expression betrays embarrassment: Saussure does not say
that a language is a code, bu t that there is a code of a language. We can
say that this first hint remained unexploited until the 1 950s. This date
has been chosen for several reasons: 1949 is the year of Shannon and
Weaver's Mathematical Theory of Communication; and 1 956 is the year of a
book which had been influenced by research in the theory of information, Jakobson and Halle's Fundamentals of Language.
After these two scientific events, the code wave crested, and the
landslide effect of the new category did not allow enough time to make
subtle formal distinctions. Thus one can record such expressions as
phonological code, linguistic codes, semantic codes, kinship codes,
codes of myths, literary and artistic codes, cultural codes, genetic code,
discrete vs. analogical coding, coded vs. u ncoded communication, behavioral codes, gestural kinesic, paralinguistic, proxemic, physiognomic,
perceptual codes - to give only some prudent examples.
Even though a suspicion of indulgent metaphorization was authorized,
it was impossible to avoid the question as to whether this code boom
represented a sort of episte mological trend, something similar to the
com mon 'formative will' that, in the domain of arts, Panofsky called
Kunstwollen. Was the code boom an instance of Wissenschaftwollen, the
proof of the active, underlying presence in human affairs of the Hegelian
Zeitgeist? Cultures know such kinds of terminological pollution: a given
term, extrapolated from a precise disciplinary framework, quickly becomes a password , a shibboleth, and, not only for cliquish reasons,
comes to designate a cultural atmosphere, an era. 'Barocco' was the
medieval name of a syllogism and became the precise designation of a
way of making art and poetry, of thinking, of behaving, of acting politically, of believing in God (as happened also with the term ' mannerism' ,
coming from painter's jargon). In such cases these metaphors have a
cognitive power and frequently announce a sudden swi tch from one scientific paradigm to another, a scientific revolution. 
Code [167]
5·3· Codes and communication
I have said that, underlying the three canonical definitions of code
( paleographic, correlational, and institutional) there is a communicational
pu rpose. What is rather curious in our story is that, from its very beginning, this purpose is more concealed or alluded to than asserted. As we
shall see in 5.4.2, the communicational purpose is implied, by no means
focused, in the mathematical theory and in jakobsonian phonology, and
the same happens with the early proposal of Levi-Strauss. I insist particularly on Levi-Strauss because the code boom starts, in the French
structuralist milieu, with Levi-Strauss' cultu ral anthropology, even
though Levi-Strauss elaborated the idea of a code because of his former
contacts, through jakobson, with the information theorists.
Les structures elementaires de Ia parente was written in 1 947, but there the
word code only turns up i ncidentally, never as a technical term (for
exa mple, "many co ntempora ry codes" are vaguely mentioned;
Levi-Strauss 1 947, I. 1.3). The basic categories of Levi-Strauss are those
of rule, system, and structure. Even when the same author in 1 945 proposed his comparison between linguistics and anthropology (Levi-Strauss
1 945), he spoke of phonological "systems" (not of phonological codes).
Code appears as a category only with the analysis of myths in "La geste
d'Asdival" (Levi-Strauss 1 958- 59).
In the concluding chapter of Les structures Clementaires, an equivalence
is posited among rule, communication, and sociality: "Linguists and
sociologists not only utilize the same methods, but they apply themselves to the study of the same object. From this point of view, in effect,
'exogamy and language have the same fundamental function: communication with others and the integration of the group"' (1947, ch. 29).
Levi-Strauss, however, is not saying that both kinship and language represent cases of communication; he suggests that society communicates
also at the kinship level because there is a more general code (I am
interpreting, since the word is not yet used here) which rules kinship,
language , architectonic forms, and other phenomena.
The point is: where there is rule and institution, there is society and a
deconstructible mechanism. Culture, art, language, manufactured obj ects are phenomena of collective interactions governed by the same
laws. Cultural life is not a spontaneous spiritual creation but, rather, is
rule-governed. These rules represent an obj ect of investigation, since
they probably are something deeper and more universal than their transitory and superficial instantiations.
As confirmation that the concept of code serves not so much to
suggest that everything is language and communication as to establish 
[168] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
that every cultural production is rule-governed , there is the first text in
which (as far as I know) Levi-Strauss introduces explicitly the te rm
'code' : his essay "Language and the Analysis of Social Laws" (1951), in
which he takes up again the thesis of Les structures elementaires, dwelling
in particular on the analogies between kinship and language. Conscious
of the daring of his hypothesis, he points out that it is not sufficient to
limit investigation to one society alone, or even to many, unless one
identifies a level at which a transition is possible from one phenomenon
to another. Thus the problem is how to devise a 'universal code' capable
of expressing the properties common to different phenomena: a code
whose use would be legitimated both in the study of an isolated system
and in the comparison between systems. The final aim is to find "unconscious similar structures . . . a truly fundamental expression . . . a
formal correspondence" (pp. 1 55 - 63).
Therefore, as in Jakobsonian phonology, the code is not so much a
mechanism which allows communication as a mechanism which allows
transformations between two systems. It is irrelevant whether these are
systems of communication or something else; what matters is that they
are systems which com municate among one another.
Thus, at its very birth , the idea . of code appears wrapped in ambiguity: bound to a pancommunicative hypothesis, it is not a guarantee
of communicability but, rather, of structural coherence and of access between different systems. An ambiguity rooted in the twofold meaning of
communication: communication as a transfer of information between two
poles, and as accessibility or passage between spaces. The two concepts
imply one another. Their confusion can be fruitful: maybe there are
common rules for two distinct operations and these rules are not ineffable but can be expressed (maybe) by an algorithm. In other words, they
are coded. Most of the resistance against the notion of code was due to
this fear of hyperrationalization as if these code-oriented theories wanted
to put human minds into a computer. On the other hand , the popularity
of the new category had all the characteristics of an exorcism: it constituted an attempt to force order upon movement, structure upon events,
organization upon earth tremors . Speaking of codes meant for many to
identify 'scripts' where, previously, only random, blind impulses, unspeakable creativity, dialectic contradictions were recognized . It was
perhaps a s hort ' ra tionalistic' season; as soon as it was possi ble,
poststructuralism replaced codes with drives, desirs, pulsions, drifts.
However, we are not interested in this new instantiation of the eternal
struggle between Apollo and Dionysus. Let us, rather, follow the technical history of our concept: the present problem is that the early avatars
of the notion of code were closer to the semantic field 'rule' than to the
semantic field 'communication and/or signification' . 
Code [169]
5·4· Codes as s-codes
5.4.1. Codes and information
In the texts of the theoreticians of information, there is a sharp distinction between information, as the statistical measure of the equiprobability of events at the source, and meaning. Shannon (1948) distinguishes the meaning of a message, irrelevant to an information theory,
from the measure of information that one can receive when a given message (which can also be a single electrical signal) is selected among a set
of equiprobable messages.
Prima facie the problem of information theorists seems to be how to
encode a message according to a rule of this type:
A --7 00
B --7 01
c --7 10
D --7 1 1
On the contrary, the true concern of the information theorist is not the
correlation between signals (as if they were expressions of something)
and their correlated content. The specific concern of the theory is the
most economic way of sending a message so that it does not produce
ambiguity. For instance, the problem can be solved by inventing a code
that allows for more redundant messages, for example:
A --7 000 1
B --7 1000
C --7 O l iO
D --7 1 001
It must be clear that the real problem of the theory is the internal
syntax of the system of I's and o's, not the fact that the strings generated
by this syntax can be associated to another sequence (for instance of
alphabetic letters) so to correlate them (as expressions) to a 'meaning' .
Thus the code of which information theorists speak is a monoplanar
system, a noncorrelational device, and as such I defined it (Eco 1976) as
an s-code.
542. Phonological code
Phonological code is also an s-code. The distinctive features which make
up phonemes are elements of a mere system of mutual positions and
oppositions, pure paradigm. They make up a structure, in the sense
defined by Lalande as "an ensemble of elements, be they material or
not, reciprocally dependent on each other, that form an organized system" (1926, "Structure" ). A phoneme is distinguished from another by 
[1 70] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
the presence or absence of one or more among the features that form the
phonological system. A phonological system is governed by a structural
rule, but this rule does not correlate anything to anything else.
It was Saussure who spoke of "code de Ia langue," but it has undoubtedly been jakobson who extrapolated from information theory the notion
of code, and the like, and extended them to linguistics and semiotics at
large. At first glance, jakobson seems to be responsible for a confusing
generalization by which the term code indicates both a syntactic system
of purely differential units devoid of any meaning and a correlation of
two series of elements systematically arranged term to term or string to
string, the items of the first standing for the item of the second. As a
matter of fact, j ust when proposing the acceptance of this notion, jakobson (1961) appeared clearly conscious of this difference : there is a code
only when there is an ensemble of forecasted possibilities based on the
correlation of a given signifier to a given signified. But "the exceptionally rich repertoire of definitely coded meaningful units ( morphemes and
words) is made possible through the diaphanous system of their merely
differential components devoid of proper meaning (distinctive features,
phonemes, and the rules of their combinability). These components are
semiotic entities sui generis. The signatum of these entities is bare
otherness, namely, a presumably semantic difference between the meaningful units to which it pertains and those which ceteris paribus do not
contain the same entity" (1968: 15). It would then be more fruitful to call
those systems sui generis simply systems, reserving the name code for
the correlations between the elements of two different systems. But frequently jakobson speaks of codes in both cases (see, for instance, jakobson 1 970). The reason is, I think, rooted in the basic concrete attitude
that Jakobson (faithful to his phenomenological inspiration) has always
showed. The notion of a purely distinctive and differential system is a
rather abstract one and could be considered in isolation only from the
standpoint of an 'algebraic view' such as that of Hjelmslev. The main
object of all of jakobson's research is, on the contrary, language in action. The langue is a theoretical tool useful for explaining why and how
longage works. Therefore jakobson cannot think of a phonological system
(or of any semiotic analogue of it) as anything other than something designed for signification. People do not invent phonemes in order to utter
them without any intention of signifying (nor in order to contemplate the
system without using it); a phonological system takes its form in order to
compose words (endowed with meanings and therefore ruled by a code
in the full sense of the term).
A l' origi ne du l angage phonique ne se trouvent pas des associations
d'elemenrs depourvus de sens qui presentent par Ia suite un sens ou sont
charges de sens. A l'origine se trouvent bien au contraire des associations de 
Code [1 7 1]
sons qui re,�:oivent leur forme specifiquement linguistique precisement en
vue d' une function de signification et qui ne peuvent etre definies sans
recours a cette function de sign ification .... Un phoneme est defini par sa
function de signe. (Holenstein 1 974: 96, 202)
Thus, playing on this double sense of code, jakobson has renounced
an emphasis on a sharp methodological distinction in order to preserve
the unity of language in action. In many authors who have been inspired
by Jakobson, this sense of concreteness has been lost, and there has
remained only a sort of imprecise oscillation between two linguistic usages of the word.
5 ·4·3· Semantic s-codes
Structural semantics studies the way in which the content of one or
many languages is segmented according to certain criteria of pertinence.
In this sense, many of the codes studied by cultural anthropology (kinship, culinary, myths) are semantic structures made up with oppositions
such as raw vs. cooked, nature vs. culture, male partner vs. female partner, and so on. The organization of the content of a given culture and
the organization of a portion of the content common to many cultures are
s-codes. Let us consider the system of kinship and take into account a
triple set of properties: (a) generation hierarchy (G0 being the Egoparameter, G + 1 the individual who generated Ego, and G - 1 the
individual generated by Ego); (b) sex (with the opposition male vs.
female); {c) lineage. We shall obtain a matrix that can be further expanded (Figure 5. I ). Such a matrix can analyze all the relationships
within the system of kinship even though we have no means for expressing certain positions, that is, certain content units made up with combined features of the system.
It happens that English has a linguistic expression for each of the
a bove positions ( from I to 9, Grandfather, G rand mother, Father,
Mother, Brother, Sister, Son, Daughter, and Uncle), but there can be a
civilization where for two items from the matrix there is a unique term
(by the way, E nglish too is able to designate both positions 7 and 9 by
the unique term sibling) and a civilization which has either no names, or
more names, for one position. Different linguistic codes can correlate
different expressions to each of the positions above; however, the system, the s-code of the kinship positions, remains unchanged through
different cultu res.
At this point, the difference between a language (as a code) and an
s-code is clear: a language correlates the units of an s-code taken as the
expression plane to the units of another s-code or more taken as the
content plane.
A language is a code because it is, in the first instance, a correlational

device. Is every correlational device a language ? Is a language only a
correlational device? What is the difference between correlational and
institutional codes? Are there correlational codes which are different
from a language? What is the difference between an institutional code
and an s-code? Such are the questions which should be answered in the
following sections.
5·5· Cryptography and natural languages
5·5·1. Codes, ciphers, cloaks
The most elementary example of a correlational code is a cryptographic
one. In cryptography a code is a set of rules which transcribe a plaintext
(in theory a conceptual content, in practice a sequence expressed in
some semiotic system, be it linguistic or else) into an encoded message so
that the receiver knowing the transcriptional rule can map backward
from the encoded message to the plaintext.
Transcriptions can be realized either by transposition or substitution.
Transposition does not require specific rules, except a sort of metainstruction warning that the encoded sequence has to be worked out in
order to find again the original order of the expression; typical examples
of transposition are anagrams and palindromes. Substitution is allowed
either by ciphers or by cloaks.
A cipher substitutes every minimal element of the plaintext with the
element of another set of expressions; for instance, every letter of the
Latin alphabet with a number, or with a letter of the Greek alphabet, 
Code [ 1 73]
and so on. Ciphers are clearly working u pon the expression-planes of two
different semiotic systems. The Morse code is a cipher.
A cloak makes entire stri ngs of a given content correspond to the
strings or to the units of another semiotic system. A cloak can work from
content to content; for example, a cloak establishing that the encoded
message /the sun also rises/ means « the D-day will be tomorrow» could
work very well even though the expressions were written or spelled out
in Chinese or in French. There are, on the other hand , cloaks working
from expressions to content: an E nglish dictionary is a cloak of this type
(/bachelor/ « unmarried male adult», where the definition could also be
expressed in French without changing the correlational rule); a bilingual
dictionary makes the expression of a given language correspond to a content expressed in a second language (definition) or to another expression
of the same second language taken as absolutely synonymous (if any).
The boundaries between ciphers and cloaks are frequently imprecise.
To which category belongs, for instance, the following code invented in
1499 by Thritemius?
A --+ In the Heavens
B --+ Forever and Ever
C--+ World withou t E nd
D --+ In an Infinity . . . (and so on)
With such a code /bad/ can be translated as « Forever and Ever, In the
Heavens, In an Infinity» . It represe nts an expression-to-expression
cipher, but_ it works also if the sentences are translated into another language (as a matter of fact, the original code was in Latin); therefore it
seems to permit also an expression-to-content mechanism.
In any case, so far we can say that there is only a category of codes
which are blatant instances of pure correlation, that is, ciphers matching
an expression to another expression, as the Morse code. We can call
these ciphers substitutional tables. Being uniquely correlational, they do
not imply any interpretation, and they instantiate a case of minimal
semiotic level. We shall see, however, in the following section, that,
except for the Morse code, certain codes used by secret agents, and
alphabets (where a given graphic signs correspond to a given sound),
substitutional tables have a very restricted and nearly theoretical domain
of usage. Every true code always correlates an expression to a series of
contextual instructions and triggers inferential processes (interpretation).
s.s.2. From correlation to inference
One can say that even substitutional tables involve some inference. In a
minimal cipher, p is equivalent to q, but only ifp is considered the token 
[1 74] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
of a type belonging to the expressive plane of a given code a. If by
chance the code were {3, then p would be the token of another expressive type and would represent the expression of a different sign-function
(see Eco 1 976, 2. 1 . ). Such an introductory choice represents a case of
overcoded abduction. In the same way, to recognize the wri tten letter /e/
as the equivalent of one sound (or more!) in English implies a certain
abductive labor; in Italian the same letter would correspond to a different sound .
Beyond this unavoidable inferential character of any communicational
approach, there are cases in which a seemingly correlational cipher is in
fact intermingled with inferential instructions. Consider, for instance,
the case of a computer receiving instructions in a binary language according to the following cipher a:
Character Zone Numeric
0 00 0000
I 00 0001
2 00 0010
3 00 001 1

The operator programs instructions in a 'numeric operation code system'
that we shall call code {3:
oo � Unconditional Jump
01 � Read
02 � Print
03 � Multiply
Suppose that now the machine must receive the instruction MULTIPLY 03
15 87, that is, multiply the content of the cell 03 by the content of the
cell 15 and place the product in cell 87. Assuming that a three-addresses
instruction has the format as represented in Figure 5. 2, the instruction
will be as represented in Figure 5.3 or, in binary digits, as in Figure 5. 4.

FIGURE 5·4
One realizes that both in the first and in the second position of the
sequence there are two binary digits that, insofar as they are a numerical
manifestation or a series of impulses, appear to be the same semiotic
expression. In fact, it is not so. The expression /OJ/ in the first position
must be referred to the operation code and must be read as MULTIPLY,
whereas the expression /OJ/ in the second position must be referred to
the address 1 - code and must be read as CELL OJ . Likewise, it is the
fact of being respectively in the second and the third position that
'means' that OJ and 15 are the cells whose content must be multiplied by
each other, whereas being in the fourth position means that the corresponding cell is the one where the product must be placed. So it is the
position which establishes of which sign-fu nction a given numerical
manifestation is the expression. In this sense, we are witnessing here
three different levels of conventions: (a) a cipher a which correfates
every decimal expression to a binary one, (b) a cloak {3 which correlates
numeric expressions to operations to be performed , and (c) a cloak 'Y
which correlates a different address to each position in the sequence .
Such a language, composed of many simple correlational codes, is no
more based upon mere equivalences. Its way of functioning is as follows:
if - according to 'Y - the digit x is found in the position a, then the
equivalence system is f3t. but if it is found in the position b, then the
quivalence system is {32, and so on. Such a complex code implies
contextual selections (see Eco 1 976, 2. I I ). Let us disregard the objection
that the machine does not make inferences; we are not interested in the
'psychology' of the machine but, rather, in the semiotics of the code - a
code that, theoretically speaking, could also be 'spoken' by h uman beings and that undoubtedly complicated the equivalence model with the
inferential one.
5·5·3· Codes and grammars
Let us consider now a code clearly conceivable for human beings but not
structurally dissimilar to the previous one. Let us invent a way of label-
[ 1 76] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
ing the books of a library in order to find them with a certain ease and to
know in advance where they can be found.
Let us suppose that every book is designated by four numeric expressions based on positional or vectorial rules (for vectors as modes of
sign production, see Eco 1 976, 3.6). From left to right, every position in
the li near manifestation of the encoded message has a different meaning, according to the conventions as shown in Figure 5.5. Therefore, the
expression /J . 2 .5.33/ will mean the thirty-third book on the fifth shelf of
the second wall of the first room. According to Eco (1976, 3.4. 9) this
mode of sign production is ruled by ratio difficilis, and the form of the
expression maps (or is determined by) the spatial organization of the
content. Such a code has a lexicon (a semantics) as well as positional
values (a syntax) and works, at a very primitive level, as a grammar.

It is 'a language' because, with it, it is possible to generate infinite
messag es. One can conce ive of the exp r ession
/J , OOO. 15,000. 1 0, 000.4, 000/ which means: << the four thousandth book of
the ten thousandth shelf of the fifteen thousandth wall of the three
thousandth room». The only problem would be whether or not such a
description has a referent in some possible world . There are no fictional
d ifficul ties in i magining a Borges-like library with thousands and
thousands of enormous rooms, each structured as a bugeye megahedron
with thousands and thousands of walls hosting billions of shelves, the
whole construction free from gravitational laws. Whether such a universe
exists or not is a metaphysical problem; whether it can physically exist or
not is a cosmological question; whether our imagination can conceive of
it or not is an interesting psychological puzzle; what matters for the pre-
Code [ 1 77]
sent purposes is that the structural logic of this code permits descriptions
of this type. This code can only generate true or false sentences (such as
there is a book so and so in a place so and so ) and could hard ly generate
texts, except in a 'me-Tarzan-you-Jane-jargon' . It provides a grammar for
a very primitive holophrastic language, but it does not seem so handicapped as compared with more respectable formal gra mmars. Our
library-language not only is a system of correlation, it also involves inferential movements and provides sets of instruction.
It has been repeatedly said that a natural language is not a code because it not only correlates expressions with contents but it also provides
discursive rules. Cherry remarked that "we distinguish sharply between
language, which is developed organically over a long period of time, and
codes, which are invented for some specific purposes and follow explicit
rules" (1957:7). If the difference is only in terms of historical growth, it
is uninteresting for our present pu rposes. If the complexity of historical
growth implies a greater organicity and flexibility, there is indeed a
difference, let us say, between E nglish and the library-code above. But
the difference lies in the complexity of inferential instructions displayed
by the E nglish language in comparison with the library-code, in the
maze-like effect produced by this complexity, and in the fact that E nglish changes faster than the library-code (a difference that could be eliminated if we decide to complicate the library-code day by day). However,
from the poin t of view of their elementary logic, both codes display the
same mechanism, where equivalences are complicated by instructions
and where the principle of interpretability holds for both. Even the
library-code can elicit many interpretations of its expression, except that,
being rather stiff, it allows interpretations only through other semiotic
systems and is not self-interpretable as a natural language. This is by no
means a minor difference, but here we are not looking for differences
(which are, besides, rather intuitive); we are looking for basic identities.
5.6. S-codes and signification
5.6. 1. S-codes cannot lie
So far we have understood why the notion of code was used to designate
many and variously complex systems of semiotic conventions. But, as we
have see n, there was also a general tendency to consider s-codes and
codes as fundamentally similar. What we must now do is to ascertain in
what sense this apparent confusion took place and why. Codes as semiotic constructions can be used to prod uce proposi tions designating or
mentioning states of the world. Therefore , with codes true or false, assertions can be generated.
This does not hold for syntactic systems or s-codes. With systems one 
[ 1 78] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
cannot lie. Provided arithmetic is a system, one who says that 2 + 2
makes 5 does not lie; it is simply wrong, and one is wrong because one
does not obey the tautological laws of the system. Obviously, there can
be a teacher cheating his students and communicating to them false notions about basic arithmetical operations; but this is not a case of lying
with arith metic, it is an instance of lying about arithmetic by using a
verbal or graphic language. This teacher in fact lies about the arithmetic
we are used to recognizing as the true one in our 'real' world, but is
building up an alternative system, no matter how internally coherent it
may be.
In the same vein, one who says that fatherhood in the kinship system
is expressed by the position G + I, J, L1 is wrong. If, on the contrary,
one says that the E nglish word /father/ corresponds to that kinship position, one lies about the English code.
One can lie by using the verbal or graphic names of the numbers (as
when one says that there are three apples on the table when in fact there
are four). But numbers as names are not numbers as elements of a mathematical system: the former can be used to mention quantities that are
not the case; the latter only allows for tautological assertions.
Nevertheless, s-codes, even though they do not permit acts of reference or descriptions of possible situations but only tautological operations, can produce strings of expressions that, by virtue of the internal
logic of the system, make one expect a further course of systematic
events. In other words, there is a sort of elementary signifying power in
an s-code, since the sequence 5, 10, 15 makes one expect 20 as the following event.
This leads us to the problem of the signifying power of monoplanar
systems (see, against this point, Hjelmslev 1943 : I II- 1 4; and, for the
opposite view, Eco 1 976, 2.9. 2). A monopolanar system can produce
signification, not i nsofar as it provides correlations, but insofar as it
permits or elicits interpretations.
A given position on the chessboard can be right or wrong in respect to
the further course of the game (the game aiming at creating, inside the
system of chess positions, cases of incompatibility and compatibility).
But a given position upon a given (token) chessboard not only becomes
the expression whose co n tent is the type position on a type of
chessboard (case of sheer monoplanarity); it also becomes the expression
whose content is the set of possible forecasting and therefore of acceptable instructions as to how go on in the game.
Thus systems and codes are different, but codes host institutional and
instructional elements, and systems display the possibility of a correlational use of their elements, since a given syntactical event 'means' (or can
be correlated to} one or more further events - and there are handbooks
recording the most plausible (or correct) among the possible correlations . 
Code [ 1 79]
In 1919, speaking of futurism, cubism, and nonrepresentational painting, jakobso n substantially anticipates (without making recourse to
semiotic te rm i nology) what is better defined in Coup d'oeil sur le
developpement de Ia semiotique (1974), that is, the function of internal and
mutual referral, or renvoi, performed by all the elements of a purely syntactic sequence: "Significance underlies all the manifestations of the 'artifice"' (1980: 25). In 1 932, speaking of musicology and linguistics,
jakobson assigns the musical sounds to the kingdom of s igns by a sort of
Husserlian definition: the elements of music are not simple sou nds
(sonic substances) but count insofar as they are the goal of an intentional
act. Sounds in music work as elements of a system and acquire a value
according to specific criteria of pertinence: a primitille who makes pertinent timbre i nstead of pitch perceives as the same melody what a
E uropean feels as two different melodies played on two different instruments. In this essay (jakobson 1 932), the phonological concept of
opposition is presented as a capital tool for the study of musical systems.
It is from this essay, as well as from the investigations of the phonemic
entities (Jakobson 1 949), that a quarter of century later there springs the
first significant interests in a li nguistics approach to music.
For this reason jakobson, even though admitting that there are purely
syntactic systems such as chess (what Hjelmslev called symbolic systems,
as opposed to the semiotic ones), i mmediately tries to find within them
the possibility of an internal signification, or "the referral of a semiotic
fact to an equivalent fact inside the same context. . . . The musical
referral which leads us from the present tone to the anticipated or remembered tone is replaced in abstract painting by a reciprocal referral of
the factors in question" (1980: 23 - 25). When there is, as in music, a
language signifying itself, "diversely built and ranked parallelisms of
structure enable the interpreter of any immediately perceived musical
signals to infer and anticipate a further corresponding constituent (e. g. ,
series) and the coherent ensemble of these constituents .... The code
of recognized equivalences between parts and their correlation with the
whole is to a great degree a learned, imputed set of parallelisms which
are accepted as such in the framework of a given epoch, culture, or
musical school" (1968: 1 2).
s.6.z. S-codes and institutional codes
From this point of view, there is a difference between tautological
s-codes (the system of numbers, the phonological code, and so on) and
those s-codes that we have called institutional codes. Institutional codes
(such as a body of laws) are s-codes, but of a specific kind. They do not
follow an uletic logic but a deontic one, or a logic of preference.
Given the numerical sequence 5, 10, 15, the expected result is 20 if the
sequence is a simple progression, 30 if its members are the addenda of 
[180] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
an addition , 750 if its members are the multiplicands of a multiplication,
a n d s o on. Once the 'topic' (so to speak) of the series has been found, its
expected further course will be as it must be .
Our expectations elicited by a given m usical course, by the move of a
chess game, and by the display of a given narrative function in the
course of a fairy tale are of a different sort: they are open to failure.
They can be more or less plausible but never mathematically sure.
Institutional codes as deontic system certainly i mply a sort of calculus,
but different from a logico-mathematical one. A system of behavioral
instructions, such as a moral or etiquette code, involves acceptations and
rejections, considers the possibility of violations, introd uces imperatives,
law reinforce ments, and concessions, is open to possibility; it is a calculus
of a modal order.
In this sense, institutional codes such as the Italian Codice Civile (see
5. 1.2 above), which seemed to dis play certain correlational features,
display a further difference even in comparison with strictly correlational
codes. If we assume that a lexicon is a correlational code matching expressions with definitions, so that definiens and definiendum are absolutely
reciprocable (but we have seen in chapter one of this book that such a
conception betrays the very nature of linguistic signs), then the Penal
Code does not provide definientio reciprocable with the definienda. When
paragraph 580 prescribes that whoever leads someone to commit suicide
deserves from one to five years of prison, this does not entail that whoever deserves from one to five years has led someone to commit suicide.
The reason is not that such a code is a correlational one endowed with
many synonymous expressions (of which a certain penalty is the constant
'meaning'); it is that in such a code there is not a correlation between
crime and punishment, bu t between a given crime and a given set of
instructions. These instructions are open to circumstantial and contextual choices (the judge must evaluate whether the culprit deserves one
or more years), but what is more relevant is that giving instructions
means to prescribe the obligation (or the suggestion) to perform something. As in other s-codes, if the j udge does not respect the dictatum of
the Penal Code, one does not say that he is lying but that be behaves
improperly.
Nevertheless, institutional codes can be used in order to produce
signification and to communicate something to somebody else. Let us
consider four examples:
A. Given a certain institutional code, my obedience to its rules stands for
my decision to appear faithful to the institution. Let us suppose that I
wish to pretend to be a Knight of the Holy Grail. I could do this by
setting up an appropriate coat of arms (but in this case I lie by using an 
Code [181]
emblem-code) or by rescuing an unprotected virgin, even though I am
not usually eager to defend the oppressed. The possibility of lying with
the s-code is due to the fact that the rules of the chivalric code are not
mandatory but are proairetic, based on a logic or preference, and consequently allow for their own rejection. Since the rules of chivalry are not
obligatory for all, by following at least one of them I make believe that I
accept them all. The noncompulsoriness of the acceptance of an s-code
makes the acceptance of some of its instructions significant.
B. Let us now suppose that, in telephoning john in the presence of
Charles, I want Charles to think that john asked me a question. I therefore utter the statement No, I do not think so or Certainly, I'll do it. In
cheating Charles I refer to a conversational rule that he too shares,
namely, that usually answers are reponses to questions, so that an answer
is the sign (in the sense of the Stoic semeion ) that there was a previous
question. By the consequent I have artificially and falsely produced ,
Charles is led to think of the most presumable antecedent. I am using in
this case Charles' presupposition that conversational rules are strictly
normative for everybody, in order to make the consequents significant of
the antecedents. In the case A I pretend to accept a system of nonobligatory rules (but a constrictive system once one has accepted it), and,
in order to pretend, I observe one of its rules; in the case B I presuppose
that everybody is bound to a system of quasi-obligatory rules and I pretend to observe one of them (while in fact I violate it). Case A is an
example of lying about the rules, whereas case B is an example of lying
with the rules.
C. One can also lie by using improperly the modalities of a literary genre
(which is an institutional system): one can begin a poem in an epic style
and then betray the reader's expectation by a sudden anticlimax, shifting
thus from heroic to grotesque. One can put into play, in a fairy tale, an
actor who apparently covers the position of the Helper and then reveals
that he was the Adversary. One can supply a hero with the characteristics
of the villain (hardboiled novel) or the villain with the characteristics of
the hero (gothic novel). All C cases will be mixtures of A and B because,
on the one hand , the noncompulsoriness of the rule permits one to pretend to accept it; on the other hand, the restrictiveness of the rules (once
the genre has been blatantly selected) permits one to make the violation
significant.
D. Besides all these cases of malicious or artistic lie , I can also make
significant the blatant violation of the rules. I do not observe the rules of

hands with a person I despise, in a situation in which the good manners
would make it compulsory, to signify that this person is outside the
realm of civil greeting.
This is how institutional s-codes can act as correlational codes.
So far, in our examination of the internal logic of both correlational
and institutional codes, we have ascertained the difficulty of clearly
separating equivalences from inferences. It seems as if there were
neither pure correlational codes nor pure institutional codes - except the
rare and blatant cases of transciption tables, such as the Morse code and
the most elementary ciphers equating expression with expression. In
every other case, we have met an inextricable web of pseudocorrelations
that involve instructions and inferences on one hand and, on the other
hand , sets of instructions that can generate relationships of signification
and processes of communication. We can say that, every time the word
code has been pronounced in the semiotic milieu to indicate both s-codes
and semiotic codes, it was this 'strong' sense of the term which was
really in play.
To find perhaps more reason to justify this attitude, we should now
consider a case where the term code seems to have been used in a naive
metaphorical way, as referred to a process or to a series of processes that
by no means can be called 'communicative' , since they represent cases
of sheer physical stimulation.
5·7· The genetic code
Signs always request an interpretation. Stimuli, on the contrary, produce
or elicit a blind reaction (see Eco 1 976, 0.7. 1). However, the expression
genetic code has been largely used in the biological milieu, since the discoveries of Crick and Watson (in the 1 950s) and at the time when jacob
and Monad discovered the transcriptional process from DNA to RNA, in
1 961 .
Obviously, we should first distinguish between what happens in the
cell and the metalanguage used by a scientist in order to describe it. The
equivalences reprod uced below, insofar as they are used by a scientist in
order to know or to say what happens when RNA reproduces the message conveyed by DNA, sound like ciphers. In this sense, we could
speak of a genetic code only apropos of the metagenetic device used by
geneticists when they speak to each other about genetic phenomena.
But once again one is compelled to ask why that 'metaphor' and not
another one has been so successfully used.
As is known, proteins are defined by a sequence of a mino acid res-
Code [183]
idues in the polypeptide, and this sequence is determined by a sequence
of nucleotides in a fragment of DNA. Since the fragment of DNA is in
the cell while the protein synthesis takes place in the ribosome, then the
information conveyed by DNA must be brought to the ribosome, and
this transfer requires a series of 'translations' . Thus the message of DNA
is translated in terms of messenger-RNA, this one in terms of transferRNA, where special enzymes catalyze the covalent association of the
amino acid with the RNA molecule. 'Translation' and 'transcription' are
metaphors; as a matter of fact, the elements in play are coupled together
because of a stereochemical complementarity, for the same reasons (so to
speak) for which a given key fits a given keyhole.
In any case, in order to show which keys fits which keyhole, one can
express this phenomenon by a sort of cipher. The nucleotides of DNA
being adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine {A, G, C, T), whereas in
the messenger RNA thymine is substituted by uracil (U), the code ruling
the transcription from DNA to messenger-RNA can be expressed as follows:
In order to determine an amino acid , a triplet of nucleotides is
needed; four nucleotides being in the position of producing 64 threeletter 'words' , and the amino acid residues to be specified being only 20,
then many different triplets can specify the same amino acid residue
{thus realizing a sort of synonymy). Certain triplets, which do not designate any amino acid, play the role of punctuation signals to establish the
beginning and the end of a given sequence of nucleotides.
We have now a second code, where the expression (for the sake of
simplicity) is written in the 'language' of the messenger-RNA and where
the corresponding 'content' (or result) is the amino acid residues:
GCU
GCU
AUU
GCC
CGC
AAC
(and so on)
GCA
CGA
GCG
CGG AGA AGG
� Alanyl
� Arginyl
� Asparagyl
As it is written, this code looks like a system of equivalences {though
between a unique content and synonymous expressions). But since the
transcription takes place through a process of steric stimuli, one could
describe the process as an instructional one. The protagonists of the
whole process 'know' ( by a sort of blind material wisdom) that, if a given
series of stimuli is provided, then a given insertion must be performed. 
[ 1 84] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
Prodi (1977) maintains that such a basic phenomenon represents an
elementary, but by no means metaphorical, example of interpretation in
Peirce's sense . Every element in the process interprets a previous one
and, in doing so, makes the process grow. A case of semiosis, even
though not unlimited.
Thus the genetic code (but this time we can speak of the one of the
organism, not only of the one of geneticists) seems to be an s-code made
up with minor s-codes, in which every element is definable in terms of
its (steric) position and opposition to other elements, but also a code in
the strong sense of the term, both correlational and institutional, where
not only x correponds to y, but where also if x then y must be realized.
More similar to a mathematical system than to a j udicial deontic code,
ruled by necessity, susceptible obviously to errors (mutations, cancer),
but not optional.
The fruitfulness of the genetic metaphor is not due to the fact that it
can say whether the genetic processes are semiotic or not. What the
metaphor reveals is that, even at the elementary level of these biological
phenomena, there is no sensible difference (a) between s-codes and
codes and (b) between correlation and instruction - that is, there is no
sensible difference between equivalence and inference, each equivalence being a quasi-au tomatic inference.
Maybe it is too hard to assume (as Prodi suggests; see 1 983) that the
bio-logic represents the model, the source, and the materialistic foundation of the 'cultural' logic, and therefore of every semiotics. It is certain,
however, that when studying both bio-logic and conceptual logic we are
in trou ble when we try to distinguish correlation from instruction,
s-codes from codes. Or, to put it in more reasonable terms, we can outline theoretical distinctions, by elaborating different abstract models, but
we are obliged to recognize that in the actual semiosis these models are
instantiated all together at the same time. Which explains (even though
maybe it does not completely legitim&te) the 'generous' use of code made
by so many disciplines in the last decades.
Undoubtedly, the notion of encyclopedia is more flexible and describes better than the one of code the kind of competence needed to
express and to interpret texts in a natural (not necessarily verbal) language . But, from the point of view of their internal structures, codes and
encyclopedias are not radically different. Both are complex networks of
complex pseudo-equivalences and of more or less cogent and constrictive
instructions. The notion of encyclopedia may differ from the one of code
insofar as it also comprehends, among other instructions, systems of
frames and scripts. But, structurally speaking, a code in the strong sense
of the term does not exclude this kind of instruction. Institutional codes
do exactly this. 
Code [185]
s.8. Toward a provisional conclusion
We are now in a position to disentangle a lot of apparent inconsistencies
and contradictions in the current literature on codes. Many of the usages
that looked rather metaphorical, self-contradictory even within the same
theoretical framework, can now reveal a more profound coherence.
In The Raw and the Cooked (1964) Levi-Strauss gives the impression of
speaking both of s-codes and of correlational codes. For instance, he says
that he is interested in "the system of axioms and postulates defining
the best possible code, capable of conferring a common significance on
unconscious formulations which are the work of minds, societies, and
civilizations chosen from among those most remote from each other" and
that "as the myths themselves are based on secondary codes (the primary codes being those that provide the substance of language)" his
book "is put forward as a tentative draft of a tertiary code, which is
intended to ensure the reciprocal translatability of several myths" (1964;
Eng. tr. , p. 1 2). Here he clearly means an s-code as a system of transformations. He is pursuing the same project later outlined in The Naked
Man: the mistake of other mythologists was
to try to understand the myths by means of a single and excl usive code,
when in fact several codes are always in operation simultaneously. It is impossible to reduce the myth to any one code, nor can it be explained as the
sum of several codes. It would be truer to say that a group of myths constitutes in itself a code, the power of which is superior to each individual code
it uses to decipher manifold messages. It is tan tamount to an 'intercode' - if
I may be pardoned the neologism - which makes possible the reciprocal
conversion of messages in accordance with rules, the range of which remains
immanent in the different systems which , through its operation, al low the
emergence of an overall significance distinct from their particu lar meanings.
(1971; Eng. tr. , pp. 44- 45)
But, as is clear from this last quotation, even in the machineries of
such an intercode, significations emerge - in the sense in which I have
demonstrated that also institutional codes, being in themselves s-codes,
permit the recognition of an immanent strategy of internal signification.
In the same work (The Raw and the Cooked, at the beginning of the
chapter "Three-Part Inventions" ), Levi-Strauss seems to change his
mind, and calls "armature" a combination of properties that remain invariant in two or several myths (the intercode?), and "code" the pattern
of functions ascribed by each myth to these properties. Here the code
seems closer to a notion of correlation. On the contrary, the many culinary, astronomical , vestimental , geographical codes that Levi-Strauss
quotes so frequently in his works, look more similar to content-
[1 86] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
structures, semantic s-codes, systems of values, as well as systems of
prescriptions. When, however, he speaks of the "conversion of the culinary code into a vestimental one" (in The Naked Man, but with a reference to a more comprehensive analysis in The Raw and the Cooked, E ng.
tr. , p. 334ff>, he seems to speak of a correlation of mutual signification
between the elements of two content systems.
Thus Levi-Strauss' codes look at the same time like syntactic systems,
like institutions prescribing norms that can be either obeyed or disregarded, as bodies of textual functions eliciting forecasts about their possible transformations and as systems of signs, since in the parental code,
for i nstance, the choice of a given partner becomes significant of the
obligations to be entertained with his or her relatives. Codes made up
with codes, a flexible web of codes, an inextricable texture of internal
and external significations, in which it is impossible to distinguish what
is semantic from what is syntactic.
Even larger and more complex is the notion of code in the typology of
cultures (Lotman and Uspenskij 1971). A code is a way of modeling the
world: verbal languages are primary modeling systems, whereas secondary modeling systems are all the other cultural structures, from mythology to art. For these authors there is a clear difference (even though the
term code seems to cover it) between equivalences (gemination of two or
more chains of elements belonging to different semiotic systems) and
pragmatic codes, whereas in their notion of text, as opposed to grammar,
there appears a clear idea of the internal signification of instructional
devices. Lotman studied abundantly different institutional codes (Lotman 1 969) which are systems of norms or of values, and once again the
opposition 'grammar vs. text' mirrors the difference between cogent institutions and textual models which suggest or prescribe by means of
examples (a given behavior is proposed as an emblem, a sample, a specimen, so that the instruction might sound like this: if you recognize the
charismatic power of this text, then you should act in the same way). In
Lotman's semiotics, correlational and institu tional aspects are hardly
distinguishable precisely because in this line of thought every social activity reveals its profound communicative purpose.
Roland Barthes frequently uses the word 'code' (and indeed he was
one of those responsible for the code boom at the beginning of the
1 960s). The fashion code (Barthes 1 967) is an s-code, a correlational and
an institutional code at the same time . There are systematic links among
vestimental units, correlations between types of clothes and social attitudes, between words and clothes, and so on.
In S/Z (1970) Barthes lists five so-called codes: semic, cultural, symbolic, hermeneutic, and proairetic. It is difficult to avoid the suspicion of
full metaphorization, and, as compared with more traditional definitions,
Barthes' codes seem to overlap each other. 
Code [187]
Through the semic code the reader detects that the name Sarrasine has
a connotation of femininity (because of the final /e/), and in this sense
the semic code does not look so different from so-called linguistic codes.
It is through the hermeneutic code that the same name, put forth as the
title of the story, articulates a question, its possible response, the variety
of chance events which can delay the answer; this title is an enigma and
the reader is led to ask: "What is Sarrasine? A noun? A name? A thing? A
man? A woman?" (Barthes 1 970; E ng. tr. , p. 1 9). The symbolic code
seems to be an imprecise set of intertextual evocations suggested by the
opening sentence ("I was deep in one of those daydreams" ) and by the
following antitheses (garden vs. salon, life vs. death, outside vs. interior). The proairetic code suggests a logic of actions, of possible narrative
developments, and elicits forecasts about the further course of events .
The cultural or reference code organizes a body of world knowledge referred to by the text.
In this sense, stresses Barthes, a code is not a mere list of equivalences:
The code is a perspective of quotations, a mirage of structures; we know
only its departures and returns; the units which have resulted from it (those
we inventory) are themselves, always, ventu res out of the text, the mark,
the sign of a virtual digression toward the reminder of a catalogue (The Kidnapping refers to every kidnapping even written): there are so many fragments of something that has been already read , seen, done, experienced ;
the code is the wake of this already. Referring to what has been written,
i.e. , the Book (of culture, of life, of life as culture), it makes the text into a
prospectus of this Book. . . . Each code is . . . one of the voices of which
the text is woven. (Ibid.; Eng. tr. , pp. 20- 21)
Prima facie here Barthes mistakes codes for the infinite process of
semiosis, or with what later will be called intertextuality. But, wrong
from the point of view of the weak sense of code, Barthes is right from
the point of view of the strong one. What he calls here code is the whole
of the encyclopedic competence as the storage of that which is already
known and already organized by a culture. It is the encyclopedia, and
therefore the Rule, but as a Labyrynth. A Rule which controls but which
at the same time allows, gives the possibility of inventing beyond itself,
by finding new paths, new combinations within the network. If the code
is not only a strict gemination of systems, or a correlation, but also a
system of inference, its fate is exactly this.
A code is not only a rule which closes but also a rule which opens. It not
only says 'you must' but says also 'you may' or 'it would also be possible
to do that' . If it is a matrix, it is a matrix allowing for infinite occurrences, some of them still unpredictable, the source of a game. It is not by
chance or by a deliberate unfaithfulness that, in the 1 960s, so-called 
[1 88] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
poststructuralist simply started from the model of the code and of the
linguistic sign to find out, beyond or beneath the rule and the organization, the 'whirl' , the difference , the beance. Since its very beginning, the
idea of code was not necessarily a guarantee of armistice and peace, of
law and order: it also signaled the coming of a new war.
Codes were introd uced to put events under the control of structures,
but very soon (maybe already with Levi-Strauss; see Eco 1 968) the ultimate nature of the ultimate codes (or the Ur-Code) was looked for so
deeply as to turn over as the concept of an unshaped 'origin' . At this
point the code became unmanageable, because it was suspected that we
do not posit it; on the contrary, we - as thinking cultural subjects - are
posited by it.
So the acknowledgement of codes (or of the Code) meant that we are
not gods and that we are moved by rules. What was at stake, however,
was the question as to whether we are not gods because we are determined by rules socially produced in the course of human history or because God is the Rule which stands behind us and our social history. In
other words (and the story is a rather old one), the code can be either
nomos or phusis either the Law of the Polis or the E picurean clinamen. For
many poststructuralists, if it was phusis and clinamen, it was not therefore
structure, but the absence of every structure.
This conclusion was un necessary and was determined by previous
metaphysical assumptions. It is possible to think of an open matrix, of an
unlimited rule, without assuming that it cannot be culturally produced .
It is possible to think of the encyclopedia as a labyrinth without assuming necessarily that we cannot describe it, and explain its modes of birth
and development.
Under the metaphoric usages of code there was at least a unifying obsession, and the eternal dialectics between law and creativity or, in the
words of Appollinaire, the constant fight between fordre et faventure. 
[6]
ISOTOPY
In The Role of the Reader I devoted several pages to the notion of topic,
defined as a cooperative device activated by the reader (usually in the
form of a question) for the purpose of identifying the isotopy for interpreting the text (Eco 1 979, 0.6.3). 1 I wrote: " ... topic as question is an
abductive schema that helps the reader to decide which semantic properties have to be actualized , whereas isotopies are the actual textual verification of that tentative hypothesis" (ibid., p. 27), by which I meant to
say that the topic as such is not expressed by the text, whereas the
isotopy is a verifiable semantic property of it. In other words, the topic is
a pragmatic device, whereas the isotopy is a level of possible semantic
actualization of the text. Yet, in order to analyze that semantic property
or indeed that level of meaning that a text manifests, it is necessary to
specify more exactly what is meant by isotopy . My hypothesis is that the
term, variously defined by Greimas and by his school, is an umbrella
term , a rather general notion that can allow for various more specific
ones defining different [extual phenomena. Only the clarification of
these differences will make it possible to throw light on the positive
theoretical aspects of the notion.
Grei mas defi nes isotopy as "a complex of man i fold semantic
categories making possible the uniform reading of a story" (1970: 1 88).
The category would then have the function of textual disambiguation,
I. For the convenience of the reader, I reproduce in this chapter the table of levels of
textual cooperation published in The Role of the Reader (Eco 1 979: 1 4). In the box on
discursive structures, I did not sufficiently develop the voice 'chosen of the
isotopies' , since the concept of isotopy was there understood as used in Greimas'
semiotics. As to the deeper intensional levels, in The Role of the Reader I developed
only a few aspects of the question, since my major interest was in the i nterpretation
of the narrative level (fabula) and in the extensional inferences (possible worlds).
[ 1 89] 
[190] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
but on various occasions G reimas fu rnishes examples dealing with
sente nces and outright noun phrases. For instance, in order to explain in
what sense the amalgam on a single classeme (either semantic category
or repeated contextual seme) makes possible a uniform reading, he gives
the example of the two expressions le chien aboye {the dog barks) and le
commissaire aboye {the commissioner barks). Given that bark has two
classemes, human and canine, it is the presence of the dog or the commissioner that reiterates one of the two that decides whether bark is
taken in a literal or a figurative sense. It should be obvious that what are
called classemes here are our contextual selections (see Eco 1 976, 2. 12. 2).
The human presence of the commissioner introduces a 'human' context
and makes it possible to make the appropriate selection out of the compositional spectrum of bark. 2
But can we say that an isotopy obtains always and only under such
conditions? Aside from the fact that, if so, it would not differ from normal semantic coherence or from the notion of amalgamation, the lists
made of the various meanings of the term by either Greimas or his disciples (see Kerbrat-Orecchioni 1 976) do say that at various times there
are isotopies that are semantic, phonetic, prosodic, s tylistic, enunciative,
rhetorical, presuppositional, syntactic, or narrative. It is, therefore, fair
to assume that isotopy has become an umbrella term covering diverse
semiotic phenomena generically definable as coherence at the various textual levels. (See Figure 6. 1.) But is that coherence obtained at the various textual levels by applying the same rules?
In the most recent developments of Greimas' theory (see Greimas and
Courtes 1979: 1 97), there is a distinction between a first and a second
stage of the theory of isotopies. The term isotopy designated d' abord, a
phenomenon of semic iterativity throughout a syntagmatic chain; thus
any syntagm (be it a phrase, a sentence, a sequence of sentences composing a narrative text) comprehending at least two content figurae (in
Hjelmslev's sense) is to be considered as the minimal contest for a possible isotopy. In this first stage, the theory considered (a) syntactical
isotopies; (b) semantic isotopies; (c) actorial isotopies; (d) partial
isotopies of a text (or 'isosemies') that disappear when the smaller units
of a text are summarized by macropropositions (Greimas calls this process "condensation" ; see ibid . , p. 58); (e) global isotopies, as the result of
the final actualization of the isotopies listed in (d).
In a second stage of the theory, the concept has been broadened in its
scope. It now designates not only the iterativity of classemes but also the
2. Cf. Greimas (1966:52- 53). Cf. also Van Dijk, "Aspects d'une theorie generative du
texte poetique" in Greimas, ed., Essois de semiotique poetique (Paris: Larousse, 1 972):
"It can be said that the central isotopy of a text is made up of the lowest seme or
classeme dominating the greatest number of lexemes of the text" (pp. 1 80- 2o6).

recurrence of thematic categories. Different figurative isotopies (semic
recurrence) can conce rn the actualization of a unique thematic isotopy,
as it happens in the cases of bibl ical parables, where minor facts must be
read as meaning the same major theme . I think that a satisfactory
example of this phenomenon is provided here by the text analyzed in
6. 1.6. Greimas gives the example of Mallarme's "Salut" (Greimas and
Rastier 1 968), where many figurative isotopies such as banquet, navigation, and writing express at an upper level thematic isotopies such as
friendship, solitude/escape, and poetic creativity. In this second stage,
Greimas and Courtes ( 1 979) also mention more complex isotopies taking
place through strategies of 'verification' and processes of 'modalization' .
Greimas himself speaks of possible worlds, and I think that these
isotopies concern the outlining of possible epistemic worlds where the
constance of a given reading level can be established only by the decision of dealing with individuals belonging to the same possible world,
without referring the same name or the same definite description to two
different individuals belonging to two mutually inaccessible worlds.
Similar cases can be found here in 6. 1.3 . and will be discussed in 6. 1.8.
In the same vein can be read the phenomena of textual ambiguity (or of
pluri-isotopicity) at the extensional level, studied in Eco 1979, apropos
of Allais' "Un drame bien parisien."
Greimas has further stressed the possibility of conceiving of texts able
to provide manifold and mutually contradictory isotopic interpretations
(without, however, supporting the assumption that a text can have
infinite readings).
Finally, Greimas has admitted that the isotopies can take place also at
the expression-plane, by accepting a minimal definition (suggested by
Rastier) according to which isotopy is the iterativity of linguistic units,
be it manifested or not at the expression-plane, belonging to both expression and content. However, he admits that such a broad formulation
can be rather confusing. As a matter of fact, it comes to cover too many
phenomena, as, for instance , cases of rhetorical metaplasms (see Groupe
1-' 1 970) such as alliteration, which do not request - in order to be
explained - the complex paraphernalia of a theory of isotopies.
That is why it seems advisable to make the term isotopy less equivocal,
stipulating the minimal conditions for its use. Perhaps the fi rst step in
this direction (such is the aim of the present chapter) is not so much to
find out a definitive definition as to distinguish different meanings of the
concept.
The diagram in Figure 6. 2 does not aim at establishing a complete
isotopic system but at showing that the category can assume various
forms, according to the representation of the levels of actualization of a
text outlined in Figure 6. 1.

6.1 . Discursive isotopies wi thin sentences with paradigmatic
disj unction
In his essay on crossword puzzles, Greimas (1970) examines this definition with its definiendum:
(I) fami des simples = herbalist
in which the clever definition arises from the fact that /simples/ has two
contextual selections, one common (context 'human') and one specialized (context 'vegetal' ). Only after it is decided that the term is understood in the second sense is it established that it counts as a substantive,
not an adjective, and therefore it is decided to decode /omi/ as «lover»
or « fan» and not as « friend ». The topic has intervened as a reading
hypothesis (speaking of plants and not of ethical attitudes), has pointed
toward the appropriate contextual selection and has imposed a rule of
interpretive coherence affecting all the lexemes involved. We can apply
the term isotopy to the semantic result of that coherent interpretation
and recognize the actualized isotopy as the 'objective' content of the
expression (objective in the sense that it is supported by the code. Naturally, in the case of this expression, which is deliberately ambiguous, or,
if we like , bi-isotopic, the objective contents are two, both actualizable).
It should be noted , too, that in this case the isotopy does not depend on
any redundance of semantic type, since ami and simples do not seem to 
[194] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
have semes in common. In truth, the final isotopy is realized by the
whole syntagm, question + solution: the herbalist is the friend of /simples/. That is to say, that once the topic has been isolated (that is, once
assumed that the subject is plants), we get the sentence The herbalist likes
herbs, in which the presence of the botanist imposes a vegetal seme
which makes it possible to actualize the appropriate contextual selection
within the componential spectrum of «simples». Cases of the same kind
are demonstrated in those puzzles called 'mnemonic c ryptographs'
studied extensively by Manetti and Violi (1977).
That is the reason these isotopies are concerned with sentences, although at first glance they seem to apply only to definite descriptions. In
each case they are characterized by paradigmatic disj unction: they depend on the fact that the code includes lexical expressions with a multiple meaning. It is evident that the paradigmatic disjunction derives from
a co-textual pressure that operates syntagmatically, but that does not
eliminate the need to decide what reading to assign to one or more componential spectrums.
Moreover, these isotopies are denototively exclusive: the subject is either
the evangelical in spirit, or it is herbs. The topic intervenes as a concurrent, cooperative hypothesis to individuate contextual selections. 3
6.2. Discursive i sotopies within sentences with syntagmatic
disjunction
Transformational grammar has accustomed us to ambiguous sentences
such as the following:
(2) They are flying planes
which can generate two different deep structures. In disambiguating the
sentence, paradigmatic disjunctions undoubtedly apply (it is necessary,
for instance, to decide whether the verb should be understood as active
or as passive), but the fundamental decision (always deriving from the
prior selection of a topic) is whether the subject is humans doing something with the airplanes or airplanes doing something. At that point, it is
necessary to actuate a co-reference and establish to whom or to what they
refers . We could say that the co-referential (syntagmatic) decision determines the paradigmatic choice concerning the meaning of the verb.
These isotopies, too, are denototively exclusive: either the subject is a
human action or it is mechanical objects.
3· The distinction between isotopies with paradigmatic disjunction and those with syntagmatic disjuncdon corresponds to the one between vertical and horizontal isotopies
proposed by Rastier and discussed in Kerbrat-Orecchioni (1976: 24- 25). 
Isotopy [195]
Here the topic intervenes as a concurrent hypothesis to actualize both
co-references and contextual selections.
6.J. Discursive isotopies between sentences with paradigmatic
disj unction
Let us examine in this connection the little story of two fellows conversing during a party, cited by Greimas (1966). The first praises the food,
the service, the hospitality, the beauty of the women, and finally the
excellence of the "toilettes." The second replies that he has not yet
been there. The second speaker, in interpreting the text uttered by the
first, blunders because he superimposes two frames (cf. Eco 1 979). The
frame 'party' undoubtedly includes the host's garments, but cannot include the condition of the sanitary facilities, or it would have to consider
also the electrical system, the water supply, the solidity of the walls, and
the layout of the rooms. These elements are considered at most as belonging, say, to a frame such as 'interior architecture and furnishing' .
The party refers to a frame that is social in nature, furnishings to one
that is technological. The individuation of the topic in this case is the
individuation of the semantic field, so as to enable contextual selections
to be effected. The French term !toilettes! is undoubtedly polysemic and
acquires two meanings according to the disj unction between the selection <<fashion» (which in turn belongs to a seme of social nature) and the
selection << architecture>> . In this case, we can certainly speak of the presence of a classeme or a dominant semantic category, since the text of the
first speaker in fact abounded in key terms containing references to the
party and to the social nature of the situation. There were no misunderstandings possible, and the story makes us laugh precisely because it
constitutes a case of awkward textual cooperation.
These isotopies have paradigmatic disjunction because, if only on the
basis of co-textual (syntagmatic) pressure, they concern contextual
selections in lexemes with multiple meaning. These isotopies, too, are
denotatively exclusive: the subject is either clothing or it is bathrooms. The
topic intervenes as a concurrent cooperative hypothesis, to individuate
contextual selections that hypothesize frames.
6.4. Discursive isotopies between sentences with syntagmatic
disjunction
This is the case of the ambiguous sentence
(3) Charles makes love with his wife twice a week. So does John.
The point is whether this short text should be read as the story of two
couples or as the story of a triangle. In this case, too, we have discursive 
[1 96] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
isotopies with alternative denotations. In extensional te rms, it is a matter
of deciding whether there are three people involved or four (see 6. I. 8. ).
In order to do so, it is necessary to decide how so should be interpreted ,
but then it is a matter of establishing a co-reference . The choice concerns the syntactic structure of the sentence , and only through a syntactic decision is the one or the other semantic result obtained. As already
seen, it is through the selection of the topic that the decision is made as
to whether the subject is two couples or a triangle: in the first case the
logical structu re of the text would be A:B = C:D, whereas in the second
it would be .A:B = B :C. It is a problem of interpretive coherence ; if four
individ uals are concerned and if A and B are compared in the first
sentence , so means that in the second sentence C and D should be compared; if, on the other hand, three people are involved and if A and B
are compared in the first sentence, so means that in the second B and C
should be compared. But it is not obvious how the two interpretive decisions derive from the redundance of seman tic categories. Here the
connection is between the topic and coreferential decisions, without the
mediation of contextual selec tio ns. At the most, as already seen,
presuppositions of frames are involved.
The two isotopies are characterized by syntagmatic disj unction. They
are mutually exclusive (the subject is either the Kinsey report or it is the
story of adultery), but they are by no means denotatively alternative:
some of the individuals remain the same in each case , only they are
ascribed different actions and intentions.
The topic intervenes as a cooperative concurrent hypothesis to establish the co-references, thus orienting the structuralization of different
narrative worlds.
6.5 . Narrative isotopies connected with isotopic discursive disj unctions generating mutually exclusive stories
The following text is the F rench translation of an extract fro m
Machiavelli. 4 It is irrelevant whether the original Italian text shows the
same ambiguity as the French; the French text will be examined as if it
were an anonymous original:
(4) Domitian surveillait l' age des senateurs, et tous ceux qu'il voyait en
position favorable pour lui succeder il les abattait. II voulut ainsi abattre
Nerva qui devait lui succeder. II se trouva qu'un calculateur de ses amis
l'en dissuada, vu que lui meme [my italics] etait arrive a un age trop
4. The text was proposed by Alain Cohen in the course of a colloquium of modalities
held at Urbina at the International Semiotics Center in j uly 1978. Cohen's analysis,
however, aimed at goals different from ours and concerned only the discourse on
Power referred to below. 
Isotopy [197]
avance pour que sa mort ne fllt toute proche; et c'est ainsi que Nerva
put lui succeder.
It is immediately evident that here we have, first of all, a choice between two discursive isotopies with syntagmatic disjunction: lui-meme
can refer to either Domitian or Nerva. If it refers to Domitian, the death
referred to later (sa mort) is the imminent death of Domitian; otherwise,
it is Nerva's death . It is therefore necessary to decide on the coreference on the basis of the choice of a topic: is the subject Domitian's
age or Nerva's? Once the co-reference is decided , there is a denotatively
alternative discursive sequence in respect to the other. In effect, in one
case, the advisor tells Domitian not to kill Nerva because he ­
Domitian - will soon die and it is therefore useless to eliminate his possible successors; in the other, the advisor tells Domitian that Nerva will
probably die soon and therefore does not present a danger for Domitian.
But it is clear that two different stories can be derived on the basis of
the two discursive isotopies. The two discursive isotopies generate two
possible narrative recapitulations. In one case, it is the story of a friend
of Domitian's giving him an argument about Power: "In dying you risk
losing Power, but by sparing Nerva and implicitly designating him your
successor, though dying you retain control of the Power, you generate
the new Power." In the other case, it is the story of a friend of Nerva's
making Domitian the victim of a courtier's wiles: "0 Domitian, why do
you want to kill Nerva? He's so old that he'll soon die by himself! " ­
and thus the courtier puts Nerva on the throne.
Thus two mutually exclusive stories emerge, whose individuation depends on the discursive actualization. Not only that, but at a deeper
level (see Figure 6. 1), there emerge different actantial structures and different ideological structures. According to Greimas' categories, the advisor can be seen as the Opponent of Domitian and Helper of Nerva, or
as the Helper of Power and the Opponent of Domitian as a mortal, or as
a Helper of Domitian and neutral in regard to Nerva. And it can be
decided that what is defined here is an ideological opposition of Power
vs. Death (in which Power ove rco mes eve n Death) or Power vs.
Shrewdness, where the courtier's wiles overcome the brutality of Power.
It can also legitimately be asked whether it is the choice of co-references
that generates the different deep structures or a preliminary hypothesis
regarding the deep structures that, in suggesting a specific topic, controls
the actual ization of the co-references at the discursive level. The interpretive cooperation is made of leaps and short circuits at the different
textual levels where it is impossible to establish logically ordered sequences.
In each case, we have seen that here the narrative isotopies are connected to these discourses (or vice versa). 
[198] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
The two narrative isotopies are mutually exclusive, but they are not at
all denotatively alternative: in both cases, the narration is about Nerva
and Domitian, except that different actions and intentions are attributed
to them. The individuals remain extensionally the same but change
some of their intensional features. Different possible worlds are developed.
The topic intervenes to orient the structuralization of these narrative
worlds.
6.6. Narrative i sotopies connected with isotopic discursive disjunctions that generate complementary stories
That is the case of the medieval theory of the four senses of the Scriptural verses, also cited by Dante (Epistula Xlll). Given the text
(5) In exitu Israel de Aegypto - domus Jacob de populo barbaro - facta
est Judea sanctificatio ej us - Israel potestas ejus
Dante says that "if we look only at the letter it means the exodus of the
sons of Israel from Egypt in Moses' time; if we look at the allegory it
means our redemption through Christ; if we look at the moral sense it
means the conversion of the soul from the struggle and misery of sin to
the state of grace; and if we look at the mystical sense it means the departure of the Holy Spirit from the servitude of this corruption to the freedom of eternal glory." Let us consider, in order to simplify matters, j ust
the literal and moral senses. Once again, everything depends on the
topic hypothesis: is the statement about Israel or about the human soul?
The decision on this affects the discursive actualization: in the first case,
Israel will be understood as a proper name of a people, and Egypt as a
proper name of an African country; in the second case, Israel will be the
human spirit, but then, by interpretive coherence, Egypt will have to be
sin (the reading levels cannot be mixed).
Here, however, alternative senses of a componential spectrum will not
be chosen, because we must foresee that, in as rich an encyclopedia as
the medieval one, Israel denoted the Chosen People and connoted the
soul. Thus it is not like the case of !toilette/, which has the sense of
either <<X» or «y » ; here the expression connotes the sense «Y » precisely
because it denotes «X». The relationship and implication is not one of
disjunction. Consequently, isotopic disjunction exists; however, it is not
based on disjunction but, rather, on implication.
Once the prefe rred reading at the discursive level is decided , various
stories can be inferred from the actualized discursive s tructures; the
moral story will derive from the moral discursive actualization just as the
literal one will from the literal discursive actualization. But the two
stories (and we know in reality there are four) are not mutually exclusive; 
Isotopy [ 1 99]
they are, rather, complementary, in the sense that the text can be read
simultaneously in two or more ways, and one way reinforces the other
rather than eliminates it.
Thus narrative isotopies are connected with discursive isotopies but
are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, they are denotatively alternative; the subject is either the Chosen People, or it is the soul (and, in
fact, the option is between various denotations and connotations). By
virtue of this choice, various possible worlds developed.
The topic (both the discursive and the narrative) intervenes to choose
between denotative and connotative semes and to orient the structure of
the narrative worlds.
6.7. Narrative isotopies connected with discursive isotopic disjunctions that generate complementary stories in each case
In his analysis of the Bororo myth of the aras, Greimas (1970) speaks of
another type of narrative isotopy. The myth in effect contains two
stories, one about the search for water, and the other about the problem
of diet. So we have a 'natural' isotopy vs. an 'alimentary' one. But in
both cases we perceive that whatever the story (or the fabula) we actualize, there is no change on the discursive level. The stories always tell of
certain people and certain events. At the most, according to the narrative
isotopy, we select certain actions as more pertinent than others, but the
actions and people doing them remain the same, even if there is a
change in the value we attribute to them in the narrative arrangement. It
is a matter of elaborating a hypothesis with a narrative theme and relying
on key terms or sente nces without, however, paradigmatic disjunctions
as to the sense of the lexemes or syntagmatic disjunctions as to the sense
of the co-references.
The persiste nce of a single discursive coherence results in this case in
the two narrative isotopies' not annulling each other, the relation between
them not being exclusive or alternative, but complementary. Although Greimas
chooses the alimentary isotopy as best, this does not mean that the story
cannot be read through the natural isotopy as well. In fact, the two
isotopies reinforce each other.
The toilettes story is characterized by two opposing readings, of which
one is clearly inferior, and, if the first speaker had really wanted to speak
of bathrooms, his utterance would have been conversationally inept because it violated the rule of relevance. That cannot be said about the
myth of the oros. Thus we have here narrative isotopies unconnected
with discursive disjunctions.
The two or more narrative isotopies are not mutually exclusive. They
are not even denotatively alternative; at most, different features are attributed to different individuals (cf. Eco 1 979), 8. 7). 
[200] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
The topic intervenes only to orient the evaluation of the narratively
pertinent features.
6.8. Extensional isotopies
Some of the isotopies examined in the preceding sections also deal with
the choice between possible worlds. Typical is the case of the text (3) in
6. 1.3 , where, in order to actualize the anaphoric power of so, the interpreter has to decide whether he is considering a world furnished with
four individuals (characterized as performing a 'legal' sexual activity) or a
world furnished with three individuals (who have the property of behaving as adulterers). Nevertheless, these two worlds are mutually accessible, and there is no difficulty in imagining the individuals of the first
world as changing some of their accidental properties, thus behaving as
the individuals of the second one.
There are, on the contrary, cases where the choice between two or
more worlds involves a radical characterization of the individuals, irrespective of the fact that they can bear the same name. Such is the case
of Allais' "Un drame bien parisien" analyzed in Eco 1 979.
Let us consider the following well known paradoxical dialogue;
(6) A: I believed that your boat was bigger than it really is.
B: Oh no. My boat is not bigger than it really is.
The conversation is certainly comic and the second speaker is certainly a
fool . Like the second speaker of the toilettes dialogue, he is a fool because he shifts from one isotopy to another, without realizing it. In the
case of the toilettes, the shift took place at the semic level. Here the
mistake is ontologically more puzzling.
The first speaker, A, is putting into play two worlds, one (w1t.1 ) which
is the epistemic world of his beliefs at a previous time, and the other
(w0t,) which is the world of his actual experience at the time of the
utterance. He is saying: "In w1t.1 there was an individual x, which I
supposed to be your boat and which was endowed with the property of
being big; in w0t0 I am experiencing the actual existence of an individual
y, your real boat, endowed with the property of being small. Since in the
present universe of discourse the only properties that x and y have are to
be your boat and to have a certain size, if I compare these two individuals of two different worlds, I notice that they have different properties.
Maybe these properties are only accidental (in the sense outlined in Eco
1 979, 8.6.2), so that x and y are potential variants of the same individual
in two different possible worlds; however, they are certainly not the
same individ ual in the same world." Speaker A is avoiding such a complicated metalinguistic series of precisions, since he thinks that B will 
Isotopy [20 1]
understand very well what he is in fact doing. On the contrary, B is
devoided of metalinguistical ability, so that his answers sound as "The y
which is the only individual of the world of my experience (the only one
I can conceive of) has not the property of being different from itself."
Such a remark is so tautological as to result in being silly. Moreover, B
does not accept the implicit request of A, that is, of comparing A's
former beliefs with A's subsequent knowledge. Thus B refuses to acknowledge that in A's discourse there were two extensional isotopies, to
be kept carefully separated one from another, and that A requests, at a
certain moment, to make a comparison between them.
6.9. Provisional conclusions
According to what has been said, it is permissible to assert that isotopy is
an umbrella term covering various phenomena. Like all u mbrella terms
(such as iconism, presupposition, code), this one shows that the diversity
conceals some unity. Indeed, isotopy refers almost always to constancy
in going in a direction that a text exhibits when submitted to rules of
interpretive coherence, even if the rules of coherence change according
to whether what is wanted is to individ uate discursive or na rrative
isotopies, to disambiguate definite descriptions or sentences and prod uce
co-references, to decide what things certain individuals do, or to establish how many different stories the same deed by the same individuals
can generate.
What should be clear in any case is that the identification of the topic
is a cooperative (pragmatic) movement guiding the reader to individuate
the isotopies as semantic features of a text. 
[7]
MIRRORS
7.1. Is the mirror image a sign?
Is the mirror a semiotic phenomenon? Or else, is the image reflected
fro m the m i rror s u rface a sign? These q u estions may well be
nonsense - in that common sense would suggest that mirrors are just
mirrors. In any case, putting such questions is not without purpose: it
might be somewhat meaningless to discover that the mirror image is a
sign, but it would be more interesting to discover that the mirror image
is not a sign and why. Even though we assume we know everything
about the mirror, excluding mirrors from the class of signs might help us
better to define a sign {or at least to define what a sign is not).
Of course, we should first establish what we mean by both sign and
mirror. But we are immediately faced with the question of whether the
two definitions may somehow be linked to one another in a circle; so
that we would not be able to decide whether we should begin from the
mirror to define a sign, or vice versa. How can we know that, if we begin
from a definition of sign, it is not so constructed as to exclude the mirror? It would seem easier to begin from the mirror (which is assumed to
be thoroughly, objectively, and unquestionably described by optics). But
defi ning what a mirror is and what it is not may depend on certain previous assu mptions - although unspoken - on the na ture of semiotic
phenomena as different from mirror phenomena.
No phylogenetic argument can be of any use in establishing a priority.
Man is a semiotic animal; this is a matter of fact, But saying so does not
exclude that man is so thanks to an ancestral experience with mirrors.
No doubt, the myth of Narcissus seems to refer to an already speaking
animal, but how far can we trust myths? From a phylogenetic viewpoint,
[202] 
Mirrors [203]
the question sounds like that of the chicken and the egg or of the origin
of language. Since we lack any good document on the 'dawn' of our
species, we had better keep silent.
From an ontogenetic viewpoint, too, we definitely have very poor certainties. We are not sure whether semiosis is at the basis of perception or
vice versa (and, therefore, whether semiosis is at the basis of thought or
vice versa). Psychoanalytical inquiries on the 'mirror stage' (Lacan 1 966)
would suggest that perception (or at least the perception of one's own
body as an unfragmented unit) and the experience with mirrors go hand
in hand. And, therefore, perception - thought- self-consciousness ­
experience with mirrors - semiosis seem to be the points of a rather inextricable knot, the points of a circle where it would be difficult to spot a
starting point.
7.2. The imaginary and the symbolic
Lat:an's pages on the 'mirror stage' would seem to solve our problem
from the very beginning. The mirror is a threshold-phenomenon marking the boundaries between the imaginary and the symbolic. When a child
is between six and eight months old, at first he mistakes the image for
reality, then he realizes that it is j ust an image, and later still he understands that it is his image. In this 'jubilant' acceptation of the image, the
child reconstructs the still scattered fragments of his body as something
outside himself - in terms of inverse symmetry, so to speak (a notion we
shall take up again later). The experience with mirrors still belongs to
the imaginary, j ust as the experience of the deceptive image of a bunch
of flowers created in a spherical mirror described in "Topics of the Imaginary" (Lacan 1 953: 101). The imaginary mastering of one's own body
which the experience with mirrors induces is earlier than actual mastering: the final development "is achieved insofar as the subject integrates
into the symbolic system and asserts itself there, through the exercise of
a true word" (Lacan 1 953). By the way, what Lacan defi nes as the symbolic is actually the semiotic , although he identifies it with verbal language . In the acceptation of the mirror image there is a symbolic matrix
into which the ego plunges under a primeval form; only language should
give it back its function of a subject "in the universaf' ( Lacan 1 966: 94).
As we shall see, this restitution back "to the universal" should pertain to
any semiotic process, although not verbal .
The mirror as the moment when the reflected ego changes to social
ego is a "structural crossroads" or, as we were saying before, a threshold
phenomenon . 
[204] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
7·3· Getting in through the mirror
However, in the event these conclusions are valid, they only tell us what
the mirror is (or, better, what use it is for) at a single moment in the
subject's ontogenesis. On the whole, the considerations of the mirror
stage do not exclude that, at any further stage in the development of
symbolic life, the mirror may be used as a semiotic phenomenon. This is
why it is worthwhile considering a different approach, that is, questioning ourselves about the use of mirrors by human adults who produce
signs, perceive themselves as subjects, and, above all, are already familiar with mirror images, rather than considering an auroral or primary
moment (be it phylo- or ontogenetic). If we consider the problem at this
stage, we can avail ourselves of our everyday experience , with a pegging
down to phenomena, instead of searching into our ancestors' experience
(which cannot be verified) or our infant children's (which we define conjecturally, based on guesswork and external data).
But, once again, the problem is whether to begin from mirrors or from
signs.
If there is a circle, we might as well get in from any point whatsoever.
Let us then get in through the mirror (without getting stuck inside it, as
we shall see), since optics seems to know a lot abou t mirrors, whereas it
is doubtful whether semiotics knows anything about signs. On the
whole, optics is an 'exact' science, and so-cal led exact sciences are supposedly more accu rate than so-called nonexact sciences. When questioning ourselves on our experience with mirrors (but from now on we are
entitled to speak 'scientifically' of catoptric experience), we might at the
most wonder to what extent catoptrics is actually exact.
7 .4 . A phenomenology of the mirror: the mirror does not invert
We initially define a mirror as any polished surface reflecting incident
rays of light (therefore excluding so-called mirrors reflecting other kind
of waves, such as repeater systems). These surfaces are either plane or
curved .
By plane mirror we mean a surface reflecting a virtual image, which is
straight, inverted (or symmetrical), specular (the same size of the reflected object), free of so-called chromatic aberrations. By convex mirrors we mean a surface reflecting virtual, straight, inverted, and red uced
images.
By concave mirror we mean a surface (a) reflecting virtual , straight,
and magnified images, when the object stands between the focus and
the observer, and (b) reflecting real, upside-down, magnified , or reduced images depending on the position of the object anywhere in space 
Mirrors [205]
between infinity and the focal point, which can both be observed by
human eyes and be proj ected on a screen.
We shall not consider parabolic, ellipsoid, spherical, or cylindrical mirrors, because they are not in common use; they do not belong to our
everyday experience. Their results will possibly be considered under the
general heading of distorting mirrors and catoptric theaters.
Already, when working out these definitions, we should question ourselves on the meaning of terms such as virtual and real. The real image
in concave mirrors is actually unreal in terms of common sense, and is
called real not only because the subject perceiving it may mistake it for a
physical object but also because it may be projected on a screen, which
is impossible with virtual images. As for the virtual image, it is so called
because the observer perceives it as if it were inside the mirror, while, of
course, the mirror has no 'inside' .
On the other hand, the definition by which a mirror image - as it is
commonly said - would have an inverted symmetry is even more whimsical. This belief (that after all the mirror shows the right place of the
left) is so deeply rooted that some went so far as to suggest that the
mirror has th is odd quality of exchanging the right with the left, but not
the top with the bottom. Catoptrics, of course, does not allow for this
conclusion; if, instead of being used to vertical mirrors, we would more
generally be used to mirrors horizontally fixed to the ceiling, as libertines
are used to them, we would come to believe that mirrors also tip top
with bottom and show us the world upside-down.
But the point is that vertical mirrors themselves do not reverse or invert. A mirror reflects the right side exactly where the right side is, and
the same with the left side. It is the observer (so ingenuous even when
he is a scientist) who by self-identification imagines he is the man inside
the mirror and, looking at himself, realizes he is wearing his watch on his
right wrist. But it would be so only if he, the observer I mean, were the
one who is inside the mirror (Je est un autre!). On the contrary, those who
avoid behaving as Alice, and getting into the mirror, do not so deceive
themselves. And , in fact, every morning, in the bath room, each of us
does use a mirror without behaving as a spastic. But we are clumsy right
when we use lateral opposite mirrors to cut our sideburns and see an
image (the reflection of a reflection) having its right side where we feel
we have it and vice versa. It means that our brain has got used to using
mirrors for what they are, faithfully reflecting what is in front of them,
the same way it has got used to turning the retinal image upside-down,
which we do actually reverse. But although our brain had mil lions of
years (including the very many before the appearance of Homo sapiens ) to
get used to retinal images, so that for quite a long period man did not
even think of this phenomenon, it had only a few thousand years to get 
[206] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
used to mirror images. And, although at a perception and motor level, it
interprets them correctly, at the level of conceptual consideration, it
cannot quite clearly differentiate between the physical phenomenon and
the deceptive illusion it encourages, in a sort of spread between perception and j udgment. So we use the mirror image correctly, but speak of it
wrongly, as if it did what we ourselves are doing with it (that is, reversing it).
If we reduce the phenomenon of mirror reflection to a purely abstract
scheme, we realize that it does not imply any phenomena of the darkchamber kind (Figure 7. 1) and that there is no crossing of rays (Figure
7. 2). It is only when we anthropomorphize the virtual image that we are
puzzled by right and left - that is, only at this point do we start wondering what right and left would be if the virtual image were the real object.
FIGURE 7. 1
FIGURE 7-2
In front of a mirror we should not speak of inversion but, rather, of
absolute congruence: the same congruence we observe when we press
blotting paper onto a page written with fresh ink. If then I cannot read
what is printed on the blotting paper, it depends on my reading habits
rather than on the relation of congruence (and, in fact, I can read it by
using a mirror, that is, by reversing to a second congruence, as it happens with laterally opposed mirrors in the bathroom). This again means
that mankind had more time to learn how 'to read' mirrors than to read
blotting paper (except Leonardo). And on blotting paper writing appears
reversed with respect to grammatological rules, but, if we consider it as
an actual imprint, ink signs are exactly where the paper was lying. Men 
Mirrors [207]
can use mirrors just because they know that there is no man in the mirror
and that the man to whom right and left are to refer is the observer and
not the (virtual) individual who seems to be looking at the observer.
All this shows us how difficult it would be to speak of mirrors as if we
spoke of them before knowing and experiencing them (and we can easily
imagine how dismayed the baby is at the fatal stage when he/she does
not yet know his/her body). When grown up, we are the way we are just
because we are (also) catoptric animals and have developed a double
ability to look at ourselves (insofar as it is possible) and the others in
both our and their perceptive reality and catoptric virtuality. Of course,
we do use mirrors more easily with respect to our body than to someone
else's. Just now, while writing, I am facing a mirror reflecting a door
with a handle, behind me. Before deciding whether the door handle is
on the right or on the left (whose right and left?) or how I should move
my arm (backward) in the event I wanted to throw my lighter and hit the
handle, I first check with and on my body. I should move my right hand
backward, toward my left shoulder, behind which I see the handle.
Done! I almost hit it. Now I know (but I knew it also before trying) that,
if I turned around, the handle would be on my right. But I had to reckon
with an inverted image, because I was actually aiming (with my eyes) at
the virtual image of the door in the mirror. It was my problem. Between
the mirror and the door (both lacking organs of perception) there was no
relation of inversion.
7·5· A pragmatics of the mirror
We usually know how to use mirrors correctly. This means that we have
introjected the rules of catoptric interaction. It means also that we are to
speak of a pragmatics of the mirror. It is no use arguing that, since pragmatics is a branch of semiotics, we cannot speak of it before defining
semiotic phenomena. I have said already that we must get into the circle
from somewhere. On the other hand, in this connection we may as well
use the term 'pragmatics' in a rather broad sense, to cover also perceptive interaction. The problem is that, in order to use a mirror correctly,
we should first know that we are facing a mirror (which is an essential
condition also in Lacan's study, for the mirror not to be a sheer illusion
or a hallucinatory experience).
Once we have acknowledged that what we perceive is a mirror image,
we always begin from the principle that the mirror 'tells the truth' . And
it is so true that it does not even bother to reverse the image (as a
printed photograph does to give us an illusion of reality). The mirror
does not even allow us this tiny advantage that would make our perception or our judgment easier. A mirror does not 'translate' ; it records what 
[208] SEMIOTIC'l AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
struck it j ust as it is struck. It tells the truth to an inhuman extent, as it
is well known by those who - facing a mirror - cannot any longer deceive themselves about their freshness. Our brain interprets retinal data;
a mirror does not interpret an object.
But it is just this Olympian, animal, inhuman nature of mirrors that
allows us to trust them. We trust mirrors j ust as, under normal conditions, we trust our organs of perception. Now it is clear why I spoke of
pragmatics: with mirrors, we can apply some of the rules which, by social
convention and very relatively, are applied to conversational interactions,
although in conversation lies are reckoned as breaches. It is not so with
mirrors.
7.6. The mirror as a prosthesis and a channel
We trust mirrors just as we trust spectacles and binocul ars, since, like
spectacles and binoculars, mirrors are prostheses. In a strict sense , a
prosthesis is an apparatus replacing a missing organ (an artificial limb, a
denture); but, in a broader sense, it is any apparatus extending the range
of action of an organ. This is why we can also consider hearing aids,
megaphones, stilts, magnifying lenses, periscopes as prostheses.
A prosthesis extends the organ range of action accord ing to the organ
mode of action, but it may have either a magnifying (like a lens) or a
reducing (pliers extend our fingers' prehension, but eliminate thermic and
tactile sensations) function. In this sense, a mirror is an absolutely neutral prosthesis, and it allows us to catch visual stimuli from where our eye
could not reach (in front of our own body, around the corner, in a hole)
with the eye's same evidence and force. A mirror may at times work as a
reducing prosthesis (cu rved mirrors or smoked mirrors, where the perception of inte nsity ratios is privileged over the perception of wave
lengths).
Prostheses may be merely extensive (like a lens) or intrusive (like a
periscope or certain specula used by physicians): mirrors may serve both
functions (that is, a mirror may be used to extend the eye's reach as if
we had a visual organ on our forefingers). Even barbers' en ablme mirrors
have an intrusive function. The magic of the mirror lies in the fact that
their extensiveness-intrusiveness allows us both to have a better look at
the world and to look at ourselves as anybody else might; it is a unique
experience, and mankind knows of no other similar one.
And, since mirrors are prostheses, they are channels, too. A channel is
any material medium for the passage of information (the notion of information is here a physical one, that is, information as a passage of
stimuli-signals which can be quantitatively measured, not yet connected
with semiotic phenomena). Not all channels are prostheses, because 
Mirrors [209]
they do not all necessarily extend an organ range of action (for example,
air is the channel through which sound waves travel), whereas all prostheses are channels or media. There may also be a channel of a channel .
For instance, if you use a mirror to reflect the rays by which somebody is
mod ulating Morse signals, the mirror is a primary channel conveying
light (it may act as a prosthesis if it magnifies the ray power or if, in a
system of mirrors reflecting one another, it allows you to catch the rays
reflected in an original mirror, which is beyond your eye's reach). But
reflected light rays, in their turn, become a secondary channel conveying
the features pertai ning to the Morse code. In any case , this phenomenon
concerning the reflection and channeling of light rays has nothing to do
with mirror images.
If we identify mirrors as channels, we can easily dispose of the cases
when a mirror image is used as the symptom of a presence . For instance,
if I look at a mirror located vertically in front of me and diagonally to the
plane of observation, I can see human shapes moving in the adjacent
room. In this case, too, the mirror acts as a prosthesis, but we might
think that - since mirror images are the symptoms of someone's presence elsewhere - it might have semiotic functions. However, any channel when working is a symptom of the existence of a source issuing
signals. If this is so, when someone is talking to me, independently of
what he is telling me, I can see his act of speaking as a double symptom:
that he is not dumb and that he wants to say something, that is, to
express an inner state. These cases, when the channel state of activity is
a symptom of both the channel efficiency and the existence of a source,
are connected to the symptomatic use of the channel rather than to the
messages it conveys. When used as a symptom, the mirror tells us something about mirrors and the use we can make of them, but nothing about
mirror images.
As a channel-prosthesis, the mirror can be a source of perceptive deception, just as any other prosthesis. I enter a room and seem to see a
man coming toward me, and then I realize it is my image reflected in a
mirror. This image 'standing for something else' , albeit temporarily,
might induce us to perceive the shadow of a semiotic phenomenon. But
it is a perceptive deception, as I can well have without mirrors, as when
I take dross for gold or see things that are not there. Similarly, deceptions can be created by presenting things which are not mirrors as being
mirrors. In a film by the Thinker Brothers there is a scene where Groucho
is looking at himself in a mirror, but the mirror is not a mirror; it is an
empty frame behind which Harpo is awkwardly (and with funny effects)
trying to imitate Groucho's gestures. This phenomenon of lying about
mirrors of course has nothing to do with mirror images. No doubt the
deceiver's performance has something to do with fiction, with significa-
[2 1 0] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
tion, with lying through signs, but all this does not concern the nature of
the mirror image. This will come up again (7. 1 2) when we deal with a
semiotics of the mise-en-scene, which might apply to the use of mirrors as
channels.
7. 7. Absolute icons
We have said that a catoptric prosthesis extends an organ range of action
and supplies the organ with the same stimuli it would receive if it could
act right where the prosthesis extends its range . In this sense, the mirror
provides me with an absolute double of the stimulating field. We might
quite naively say that the mirror provides me with an icon of the
object - if we define the icon as an image having all the properties of its
denotatum. But catoptric experience tells me that (if any sign called icon
and endowed with these properties exists) a catoptric absolute icon is not
an icon but a double (see Eco 1 975 , 3-4-7). At the macroscopic level of
my perceptive experience and to the practical purpose it must serve, the
sheet of paper I am writing on is the double of the sheet I have j ust
filled. But this is not a good reason to consider the former a sign of the
latter. You may argue that the mirror image is not to its object as the
former sheet is to the latter. But you should not forget that the mirror
image is not a double of its object but, rather, a double of the stimulating field one could have access to if one looked at the object instead of
looking at its mirror image. The fact that the mirror image is a most
peculiar case of double and has the traits of a unique case explains why
mirrors inspired so much literature; this virtual duplication of stimuli
(which sometimes works as if there were a duplication of both my body
as an object and my body as a subject, splitting and facing itself), this
theft of an image, this unceasing temptation to believe I am someone
else, makes man's experience with mirrors an absolutely unique one, on
the threshold between perception and signification. And it is precisely
from this experience of absolute iconism that the dream of a sign having
the same characteristics arises. This is why men draw (and produce the
signs which are precisely defined as iconic): they draw to achieve without mirrors what mirrors allow them to achieve. But the most realistic
drawing does not show all the characteristics of absolute duplication as a
mirror does (besides having a different relation of dependence to its object).
Man's experience with mirrors may then explain the emergence of a
notion like the (semiotic) one of iconism but is not explained by it.
However, the mirror as a threshold phenomenon may lend itself to a
number of operations making it even more 'threshold' . I can, in fact,
red uce the absolute iconism of mirror images, and smoked mirrors are an
excellent example of this technique. The mirror almost becomes a reducing prosthesis. 
Mirrors [2 1 1]
Let us imagine a mirror made of horizontal strips of reflecting material
with thin opaque strips in between. The virtual image I see is obviously
incomplete. At the level of perceptive reconstruction, the result may
nevertheless be excellent, with varying degrees of efficiency depending
on the thickness of opaque strips. If we imagine opaque strips of a reasonable thickness, even though the reflected image is not mine ( because, of course, I know a lot about my image, and the reconstruction of
the perceptum may in this case be affected by previous information), I can
satisfactorily perceive the reflected object. This, of course, does not exclude that some elements of interpretation (although very slight ones) do
come into play. Such interpretation, however, also affects the perception
of obj ects in the world around us. Darkness, the presence of opaque
obstacles, fog are all 'noises' in the channel diminishing sensory data and
requiring interpretative efforts in order to achieve the (often conjectural)
formation of a perceptum. If these conjectural and interpretive efforts are
to be taken as semiosic, then semiosis creeps into any aspect of our
relation to the surrounding world. But, even if we take this for granted,
we should not conclude that any aurorally semiosic process is productive
and interpretive of signs. If also mirrors i mpose semiosic processes, one
thing remains to be defined, that is, in which sense these processes do
not lead to the production, interpretation, and use of signs.
7 . 8 . Mirrors as rigid designators
The mirror has a peculiar characteristic. As long as I look at it, it gives
me back my facial features, but if I mailed a mirror which I have long
looked at to my beloved, so that she may remember my looks, she could
not see me (and would instead see herself).
The self-evident datum I have just highlighted deserves some
thought. If we compared mirror images to words, they would be like
personal pronouns: like the pronoun /1/, meaning " Umberto Eco» if I
pronounce it, and someone else if someone else does so. I may, however, happen to find a message in a bottle reading "I was shipwrecked in
the Juan Fernandez islands" ; it would be clear to me that someone
(someone who is not myself) was shipwrecked . But, if I find a mirror in a
bottle, after taking it out with considerable effort, I would always see
myself in it, whoever may have sent it as a message. If the mirror
'names' (and this is clearly a metaphor), it only names a concrete object,
it names one at a time, and it always names only the object standing in
front of it. In other words, whatever a mirror image may be, it is determined in its origins and in its physical existence by an object we shall
call the image referent.
In an extreme attempt to find one more relation between mirror images and words, we might compare mirror images to proper names. If in 
[2 12] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
a crowded station I would shout John! I am likely to see a great many
people turning around - which allowed many to say that proper names
have a direct relation to their bearers . Yet, if someone looking out of the
window would say Look, there comes John!, inside the room and without
knowing John, I would know that the other saw (or says he saw) a male
human being (provided he is making an appropriate use of language). If
this is so, then even proper names do not refer directly to an object
whose presence determines the proper name utterance . Not only could
my comrade lie, and mention john when John is not there, but the linguistic expression John first and foremost refers me to a general content.
So much so that, if someone would eventually decide to christen his
newborn daughter John, I would tell him that he is making an inappropriate use of current onomastics, since John usually names males.
Therefore , there is a difference between a mirror image and a proper
name, in that a mirror image is an absolute proper nome as it is an absolute
icon . In other words, the semiotic dream of proper names being immediately linked to their referent (j ust like the semiotic dream of an
image having all the properties of the obj ect they refer to) arises from a
sort of catoptric nostalgia. There is actually a theory of proper names as
rigid designators (Kripke 1 972) by which proper names could not be
mediated by definite descriptions ( like John is the fellow who . . . ) but
could undergo counterfactual exercises (like Would John still be John, were
he not the fellow who . . . ?). An unbroken chain of designations, called a
'causal' chain, links them to an original object they were allocated to by
a sort of initial 'baptism' .
Now, it is mirrors which allow us to imagine this kind of situation. Let
us assume that along a certain distance , between point A, where the
reflected obj ect is located, and point B, where the observer is standing
(who under normal condi tions cannot see point A), we fit an unbroken
series of mirrors at regular intervals and at a suitable inclination, so that
by chain reflection, the observer in B may see the object image from A
in the nearest mirror.
We would always be in the case of a prosthesis-channel. Of course, we
must necessarily assume that there is an odd number of mirrors. Only in
this event would the mirror nearer to the observer give him an image of
the original object as if it were reflected in the first mirror. With an even
number of mirrors, in fact, the image would be 'reversed' twice, and we
would not be in the presence of a simple prosthesis but, rather, of the
effect of a more complex catoptric apparatus, this having translation
functions. In any case, for the problem we are concerned with here, the
observer need only know that there is an odd or even number of mirrors,
and he will then behave as he does when facing his bathroom mirror or
his barber's mirrors. Now, on the grounds of the principles enunciated in 
Mi rrors [2 13]
our previous pragmatics of the mirror, the observer knows (a) that the
final mirror is a mirror and (b) that it is telling the truth; therefore, he
also knows (c) that, at that very moment, the reflected object does exist
in point A. Through this causal chain, the final mirror image becomes a
rigid designator of the object which is the source of stimuli; better still,
we know that the final image 'christens' , so to say, the initial object in
that very moment.
Such catoptric apparatus would be a rigid-designation apparatus.
There is no linguistic contrivance which would provide the same guarantee, not even a proper name, because in this event two conditions of
absolutely rigid designation would be missing: ( 1) the original object
might well not exist at the moment and also might never have existed;
(2) there would be no guarantee that the name corresponds to that object
alone and to no other having similar general characteristics.
We therefore come to discover that the semantics of rigid designation
is in the end a (pseudo-) seman tics of the mirror image and that no
linguistic term can be a rigid designator (just as there is no absolute
icon). If it cannot be absolute, any rigid designator other than a mirror
image, any rigid designator whose rigidity may be undermined in different ways and u nder different conditions, becomes a soft or slack designator. As absolutely rigid designators, mirror images alone cannot be
questioned by counterfactuals. In fact, I could never ask myself (without
violating the pragmatic principles regulating any relation with mirrors):
"If the object whose image I am perceiving had properties other than
those of the image I perceive, would it still be the same object?" But
this guarantee is provided precisely by the threshold-phenomenon a mirror is. The theory of rigid designators falls a victim of the magic of mirrors.
7·9· On signs
If the mirror has nothing to do with proper names, it has nothing to do
with common nou ns, either, which always refer (except with regard to
their indexical use) to general concepts. But this does not mean that the
mirror image is not a sign because semiotic tradition, from Hellenism to
the present days, has developed a sign concept which goes beyond the
mere concept of verbal sign.
According to the earliest definitions, a sign is aliquid which stat pro
aliquo. The most elementary type of recollectable sign, as theorized by
the Stoics, is smoke which stands for fire.
At this point, we should establish whether the mirror image stands for
the body emanating it as a reflection just as s moke stands for the fire
which produces it. 
[2 14] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
A correct understanding of the first and most thorough sign theory
ever produced (that is, the Stoics theory) will inevitably lead us to assume that anything may be taken as a sign of anything else provided that
it is an antecedent revealing a consequent - where antecedent and consequent have the value they assume according to the logical ratio of i mplication p ::J q. Thus the consequent migh t well be the more or less
chronologically remote cause of the antecedent- as it is in the case of
fire and smoke.
However, this definition (as we have seen in chapter one of this book)
is not sufficient to characterize a sign as such. The semiotic requirements are the following:
(1) In order that the antecedent might become a sign of the consequent,
the antecedent must be potentially present and perceptible while the
consequent is usually absent. For the Stoic semeion, the absence of the
consequent seems to be strictly necessary: if one sees s moke billowing
out of flames, there is no need to consider it a sign of fire. Words and
many nonverbal indexical devices can be produced while their referent is
present, but their condition for being a sign is that they must be understandable as sign even though their supposed referent is not there. The
consequent may be absent whether because it is out the reach of my
actual perceptibility or because it does not subsist any longer at the very
moment in which I interpret the sign (think, for example, of the tracks
of prehistorical animals). As Abelard said, the power of language is given
by the fact that the expression nulla rosa est (translatable either as there is
no rose or as such a thing like a rose has never existed) is fully comprehensible
even though there are no roses.
(2) As a result, the antecedent may be produced even though the consequent does not subsist or has never subsisted . One can produce smoke
by means of chemical substances thus pretending that there is (somewhere) fire . Signs can be used to lie about the world's state of affairs.
(3) Signs can be used to lie because the antecedent (expression) does not
require the consequent as either its necessary or its efficient cause. The
antecedent is only presumed to be caused by the consequent.
(4) This happens because the antecedent is not primarily related to an
actual state of affairs but to a more or less general content. In every
signification system, the consequent conveyed by the antecedent is only
a class of possible consequents. Signs can be referred to referents because
they are pri marily correlated to a content (extensions are functions of the
intentions). Even a gestural index, like a finger pointing at something,
before being characterized by its contiguity to the object indicated, is
characterized by the fact that, in a given gestural convention's system, it 
Mirrors [2 1 5]
signifies « focus your attention on the possible object in the radius of the
digital apex» ; in fact, I might indicate something which does not exist,
and my (deceived) interlocutor will at first be led into thinking that
something must be there. This something is the consequent content of
the antecedent-expression /finger pointed at something/.
(5) But the Stoics' semiotics tells us something more. It does not tell us
that smoke as a sign is s moke as a material occurrence. The Stoics' sign is
incorporeal: it is the relationship of implication between two propositions
( 'if there is s moke there must be fire', which could also be translated in
terms of a law: 'each time there is smoke there must be fire'). The
semiotic relationship is, therefore, a low correlating a type-antecedent to a
type-consequent. The sign is not given by the fact that this smoke au tomatically leads me to that fire, but that a general class of occurrences
recognizable as smoke automatically leads me to the general class of occurrences definable as fi re. The relationship exists between types rather
than between tokens. In other words, the in terpreter of certain semiotic
situations makes them occur as relations between tokens owing to the
fact that he knows (while the barbarian does not) that - first of all - the
same relation holds between types.
(6) The fact that the semiotic relationship occurs between types makes it
independent of the actual channel or medium in which and by which its corresponding occurrences are produced and conveyed . The smoke-to-fire
sign relationship does not change whether or not the smoke is chemically
produced or spoken about or portrayed by images. The relationship linking dots and dashes to the letters of the alphabet as codified by Morse
code does not change according to whether the dots and dashes are conveyed by electric signals or tapped out by a prisoner against the wall of
his cell.
(7) Finally (and here the original Stoic concept is partially developed),
the content of an expression may be interpreted. If after seeing smoke
somebody tells me there is fire, I might ask him what he means by fire,
and he might explain this by showing me some fi re, or with the image of
a flame, or by giving a verbal definition, or by causing me to recollect a
sensation of heat, or by reminding me of a past event when I experienced the presence of fi re. In the same way, when hearing the name
John I might ask for the meaning of this name, and the speaker need not
necessarily show me john, he only need define him in one way or another (Lucy's husband, the guy you met yesterday, the one portrayed in
this miniature, the guy who walks moving his head like this or like that,
and so on ... ). Each interpreta tion not only defines the con tent of the
expression, but also in its own way provides me with more information
(Peirce, C. P. 8. 322). 
[2 16] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
7. 10. Why mirrors do not produce signs
In the light of what has been said above, the mirror image does not meet
the requirements for a sign. One cannot say that, when discovering
through a mirror that someone is standing behind one, one infers a consequent by an antecedent. Since, as we have seen, mirrors are prostheses, this inference is not so different from the many pseudo-inferences
one can draw from the use of periscopes or binoculars: if I see something
through them, then there must be something. But this inference is not
dissimilar from the fundative inference that rules our relationship with
our own senses: if I see something, then it means that there there is
something.
(la) The mirror image (even when it is taken as an antecedent) is present in the presence of o referent which cannot be absent. It never refers to
remote consequents. The relationship between object and image is the
relationship between two presences, without any possible mediations.
The consequent (by virtue of the prosthesis action of the mirror) comes
into the radius of the interpreter's perceptibility.
(2a) The image is causally produced by the object and cannot be produced in the absence of the object itself.
(3a) Thus, as we have already seen, the mirror image cannot be used to lie.
We can lie about mirror images ( making phenomena which are not mirror
images pass as such), but we cannot lie with and through a mirror image.
(4a) The mirror image cannot be correlated to a content, or, rather, it might
well be (I look at my image in the mirror to reflect on the generic characteristics of the human body), only by virtue of its necessary relationship to the referent. The signs can refer to a referent because they
automatically refer us to a content, whereas the mirror image refers only
to one content as it has a primary relationship with the referent.
(Sa) Thus the mirror image never establishes a relationship between
types but only between tokens, which is another way of distinguishing
the imaginary from the symbolic - where the symbolic implies a 'universal' mediation which is in fact the relationship between types.
(6a) It goes without saying that the mirror image is not independent of the
medium or channel in which it is formed and by which it is conveyed. It is
embodied by one, and only one, channel, the mirror.
(7a) In the end, the mirror image cannot be interpreted. At most, the object
to which it refers can be interpreted (in terms of different types of inferences, definitions, and descriptions which are increasingly analytical), or, 
M i rrors [2 1 7]
rather, the sti mulating field from which the double is produced . The
image as such can only be reflected as such by a second (third, fou rth ... )
mirror. On the other hand, if the interpretability is an inherent featu re of
the content, an image without content cannot by definition be interpreted
(at least in the sense which we have given to the concept of interpretability).
7. 11. Freaks: distorting mirrors
Mirror images are not signs and signs are not mirror i mages. And yet
there are cases when mirrors are used to produce processes which can be
defined as semiotic.
The first peculiar case is that of distorting mirrors, whose amazing
effects were already observed by Arab physicists and in Le Roman de Ia
Rose. A strange prosthesis, the distorting mirror amplifies but distorts the
organ's function, as a hearing aid which transforms all conversation into a
pop song. Therefore, a prosthesis with hallucinatory functions. If we
take hallucinatory substances, we continue to perceive shapes, colors,
sounds, and s mells, but in an altered form . The sensory organs function
abnormally. And yet we know that these are our sensory organs, which
we usually trust. If we are not aware that we are drugged, we trust them,
with the most u nforeseeable effects; if, on the other hand, we are aware,
in that we are still able to control our reactions, we force ourselves to
interpret and translate the sensorial data to reconstruct 'correct' perceptions (or, rather, analogous to the perceptions of most human beings).
The same thing occurs with the distorting mirror. If we know neither
that it is a mirror nor that it is distorting, we will therefore find ourselves
in a situation of normal perceptive deceit. It is j ust a question of noise on
the channel. At times this noise is not perceived as such, and if while
speaking to someone on the telephone the line is disturbed, we are
bound to assume that the noises are the m utterings, the coughing, or the
hoarseness of the person we are talking to. But in this case we are
wrongly interpreting sensations, and once again we are taking dross for
gold.
The case where we know that we are in front of a distorting mirror, as,
for instance, at a fun fair, tends to be more interesting.
Our attitude is therefore double: on the one hand, we find it amusing;
that is, we enjoy the hallucinatory characteristics of the medium. We
therefore decide (for the sake of playing) to accept that we have three
eyes or an enormous stomach or very short legs, j ust as we accept a fairy
tale. In reality, we give ourselves a sort of pragmatic holiday: we accept
that the mirror, which usually tells the truth, is lying. But the fact that
our disbelief is suspended does not concern the image as m uch as the 
[2 1 8] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
distorting prosthesis. The game is a complex one : on the one hand, I
behave as if I were standing in front of a plane mirror telling the truth,
and I find that it gives back an 'unreal' image (that which I am not). If I
accept this image, I am helping, one could say, the mirror to lie. The
pleasure that this game gives me is not of a totally semiotic nature but of
an aesthetic nature. I do the same with other prostheses if, for example,
I observe the world through colored lenses. But this game is not so different from the one I play when in the midst of an incredible hum of
voices: I place the palms of my hands over my ears, lifting my hands off
and replacing them rhythmically in order to hear an 'unreal' noise.
However, at the same time (or immediately afterward), another attitude comes into play: since I know that I am standing in front of the
mirror, I imagine that in one way or another it always tells the truth
because it reflects (even if poorly) incident rays emanating from my
body. (Naturally, the same applies if I look at someone else's body in
the distorting mirror; however, there is no doubt that the whole business
becomes psychologically more interesting, from a narcissistic point of
view, if that body is mine.)
Under these circumstances I interpret the data given back to me by
the mirror, in the same way in which, with regard to refractory phenomena, even if I continue to see the stick which is broken in half by the
water, I nonetheless interpret these data by continuing to accept this
stick as unbroken. Interpretive rules to decode the optical illusions exist
(if not at a perceptive level, at least at a level of intellectual judgment).
In front of the distorting mirror, I put a few projective rules to the test,
so that a given length or width of the virtual image must proportionally
correspond to different lengths or widths of the reflected object. I proceed as if I had to interpret a type of cartographic projection in terms of
another. These projective rules are no different from the ones I apply in
order to recognize, in a stylized or grotesque drawing, the characteristics
of the object or the cl ass of type-objects to which it refers. In this sense
the experience of the distorted image constitutes a further threshold
phenomenon which shifts the boundaries betwee n catoptrics and
semiosis. If the distorted image were not also parasitic with respect to its
referent, we would have to ad mit that it has many semiotic characteristics, even if rather vague, imprecise, and erratic. For example, in
this relationship (which is always a token-to-token one), I am forced to
see myself as another (as a dwarf, a giant, a monster): it is like the
beginning of a generalization process, the negligence of the referent to
fantasize on the content - even if in terms of a continually repressed
temptation controlled by a consciousness of the singularity of the phenomenon, a cold reasoning on a hallucinatory situation. There is that
extra knowledge concerning what I am or could be, the dawn of a counterfactual exercise - the beginning of semiosis. 
Mirrors [2 1 9]
Perhaps, in accordance with this possibility, we relegate the distorting
mirrors to enchanted castles, so as not to question the frontier between
catoptrics and semiosis which we have instinctively demarcated so well.
Finally, undoubtedly the image reflected by the distorting mirror is an
indication of the fact that the mirror as a channel is in fact a distorting
one. Just as the image of the broken stick tells me that (as if I didn't
already know) the stick is immersed in water. We have already described
these symptomatic uses of the image, where the image does not give us
information about the object, but about the nature of the channel. In
these cases it is my perceptive surprise which becomes the symptom of
the channel anomalies (how can I see a broken stick and my face with
three eyes when I know that 'it is not the case'?), so that the semiosis
effort actually is between the perceptive surprise (equivalent in this case
to an anomalous thermic sensation) and the channel, not between the
image and the object.
7.12. Procatoptric staging
Let us consider a inore disquieting event. I am in a room, in front of me
is a vertical mirror, located at a slant with respect to the rays emanating
from by body. Actually, I do not see myself, but somebody in the adjoining room, who acts without knowing someone is looking at him. The
case is similar to the sheriff in Westerns who sees the bandit coming in
behind him in the mirror over the cou nter in front of him. These cases
are not perplexing; we said already that the mirror is a prosthesis and at
times has the same intrusive action as a periscope.
But let us now imagine that in the adjoining room there is a subject SI
who knows that S2 is spying on him in the mirror, but assuming (correctly) that S2 thinks that SI does not know S2 is seeing him do so.
Now, SI wishes to make S2 believe that S2 (thinking he is unseen) is
doing something commendable and behaves in a way S2 is to consider as
spontaneous although Sr behaves so only and exclusively for (or against)
82. SI is therefore staging an almost theatrical performance, the difference being that the audience should mistake theater for reality. Then,
SI is using the mirror image to lie. Is there anything semiosic in such a
situation?
Everything is semiosic in it, and yet nothing concerning the mirror
image as such . Even in verbal language I can u tter a true statement in
order to make my listener believe something else (about my ideas, my
feelings, and so on). The same happens in this case. The mirror image
still retains each and every characteristic of dull faithfullness it would
have in the event SI were behaving earnestly; it reflects exactly what SI
is doing. It is j ust that what SI is doing is a mise-en-scene, and therefore a
semiosic contrivance. 
[220] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
There is a profilmic staging (Bettetini 1975). Our beliefs about the
faithfulness of the camera usually have nothing to do our beliefs about
the 'truth' of the scene that the camera is going to shoot. When a movie
shows a fairy with seven dwarfs in a flying coach, one knows that such a
situation is fictional even though one trusts the faithfulness of the recording apparatuses shooting it. Only children take the mise-en-scene for
reality as wel l, but this lack of maturity concerns their competence about
a semiotics of mise-en-scene, quite apart from their possible lack of competence about a semiotics of filming.
Similarly, there is a procatoptric staging which can create deceptive
situations. But, in this case, any semiotic consideration should shift from
mirror images to staging, the mirror images being mere channels of procatoptric messages. These considerations also suggest that, besides procatoptric staging, there may also be a grammar of the shot and a specific
syntax of catoptric editing. 81 may incline the mirror so that 82 can only
see some aspects of the scene taking place in the adjoining room (independently of whether it is real or staged). Mirrors are
. always 'framing'
devices, and inclining them in a certain way is a way to exploit this
specific quality of them. Once again, however, this semiosic contrivance
does not concern mirror images (which as usual depict things just as the
mirror 'sees' them) but a manipulation of the channel.
Let us now imagine that 81 has a remote control to incline the mirror
as he likes, so as to show 82 different corners of the adjoining room, at a
few seconds' interval. If, at one angle, the mirror shows a certain object
and, at another, someone staring blankly in front of him, 81 might create
catoptric images similar to what in film editing is called the Kuleshov
effect. According to the 'editing' he works out, 81 may make 82 believe
that the man sitting in the adjoining room is looking at various objects in
anger, lust, or surprise. A swift play of inclination and the mirror might
make 82 lose the sense of actual space relations between objects. In this
case, moving mirrors might create a true semiosic situation, a tale, a
fiction, a doxastic concoction.
If we use mirrors as channels, staging, shot, and editing are made
possible. They are all semiosic contrivances which yield most when used
in connection with non-mirror images. What would remain unchanged is
the asemiosic nature of mirror images, which are always causally related
to their referents. 82 might be inclined to universalizing processes, almost forgetting he is observing mirror images, thus living a type-story
rather than a token-story.
But the very nature of this story's being connected to the mirror would
make it forever related to its causative referent, would still keep it half
way between semiosis and catoptrics, between the symbolic and the
imaginary. 
Mirrors [ZZ 1]
7- IJ. Rainbows and Fata Morganas
Rainbows are phenomena of partial reflection, although combined with
refraction and dispersion of sunlight passing through tiny drops of water
in the lower layers of the atmosphere. However, their image is never
perceived as mirror image. A rainbow can be employed semiosically in
two cases only. It can be seen as a wonder, a sign given by the gods, but
to the same extent as storms, tidal waves, eclipses, and the flight of
birds. From time immemorial, mankind has rendered a number of physical phenomena semiosic, although not in view of their specific catoptric
nature.
However, a rainbow can be read and used as a symptom (of the end of
a storm). Under this respect, it may even work without its conjectured
referent, since rainbows occur in waterfall gorges, too. In any case, even
when correctly used as a symptom of the presence of water drops suspended in the atmosphere, it indicates an anomalous condition of the
channel , rather than an actual object.
As to Fata Morganas and the like, they are never perceived by a naive
observer as mirror phenomena: they are, in fact, instances of perceptive
deceptions. In contrast, to a critical eye they may look like the symptom
of either a given condition of the atmospheric channel or the presence of
a distant object. On these grounds, they may even be used as mirror
images of that object and, thus, as prostheses.
7. I 4· Catoptric theaters
Precisely through phenomena like Fata Morganas, we are led to deal
with other plays of mirrors known across the centuries as Theatrum catoptricum, Theatron polydicticum, Theatrum protei, Speculum heterodictum, Multividium, Speculum multiplex, Tabula scalata, and so on (see Baltrusaitis
1 978). All such contrivances can be grouped into three main classes:
(a) Mirrors multiply and alter the virtual images of objects, which, somehow staged, are recognized by the observer as being reflected in a mirror.
(b) Starting from a staged object, a combined play of different curved
mirrors creates real images the observer is supposed to ascribe to a wonder.
(c) Suitably arranged plane mirrors produce, on a mirror surface, the
image of several superimposed, juxtaposed, and amalgamated objects, so
that the observer, unaware of the catoptric play, gets the impression of
prodigious apparitions. 
[222] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
Now, in the first case, the observer is aware of the catoptric nature of
the play, so he is in no different position from one who personally controls a set of mirrors faci ng one another at different angles. He may enjoy
the manipulation of the channels from an aesthetic point of view. When
he watches the staging of a play with a pair of binoculars, the latter are
meant to improve his perception of such a staging. In contrast, in this
case, the staging itself is meant to improve the aesthetic perception of
the possibilities offered by the prosthesis-channel . Any event enjoyed
aesthetically involves self-reflectiveness: one's attention focuses not only
on the form of the messages but also on the way the various channels are
used. Likewise, the performance of an orchestra is appreciated not only
in view of the melody (which, as such, is independent of the channel)
but also because of the way the resources of an instrument are exploited.
In cases (b) and (c), we are back to situations similar to Fata Morganas, and optical illusions in general . Mirrors are once again used as
channels, but the observer cannot focus his attention on them, being
unaware of their presence. At the most, he aesthetically enjoys a staging
whose nature he ignores. And in case he thinks he is facing a wonder,
his position is the same as that of an observer who, seeing himself in a
mirror, believes he is in front of an actual intruder. Sheer perceptive
deception, rather than a mirror image experienced as such . In light of
the typology of the modes of sign prod uction (see Eco 1 976, 3.6.6), such
perceptive deceptions can be described as the result of programmed
stimuli. As a matter of fact, they are based on a staging which is a
semiosic phenomenon (so much so that it could be channeled otherwise;
besides, mirror theaters are no longer used since different methods of
projecting images have become available), but the mirror images employed are true and asemiosic in themselves.
7· •5· Mirrors that 'freeze' images
Let us conti nue with our phenomenological experiment, imagmmg
magic mirrors (that is, really magic and not simply used to give an
impression of magic).
Assume we have a 'freezing' mirror: the reflected image 'freezes' on
its surface, even when the object disappears . Eventually, we have established a relationship of absence between antecedent and consequent.
However, we have not eliminated the causal connection between original referent and image. We have moved further, but just a little. A photographic plate is in fact a freezing mirror. Needless to say, we assume
the existence of a plate capable of reproducing an image with a very high
definition (wavelength, intensity relation, and outlines), and, after all,
we have decided to accept even the images reflected in mirrors that are
either broken or crossed by opaque strips. 
Mirrors [223]
What makes a picture similar to a mirror image ? A pragmatic assumption whereby a dark room should be as truthful as a mirror and, at any
rate, testify to the presence of an imprinter (present in the case of mirrors, past in that of photography). The difference l ies in the fact that the
exposed plate is indeed an imprint or a trace.
A trace differs under certain respects from a mirror image, even disregarding image reversal on the plate, its further reversal on the printed
picture, and the recovery of its inverse symmetry, that is, the actual
inversion of the congruence characterizing mirror images.
The main point is that imprints are motivated but heteromaterial (Eco
1 976, 3.6): the plate turns light rays into diff erent matter. We no longer
perceive light rays, but pure intensity relations as well as pigmentation
relations. Thus there has been a projection from matter to matter. The
channel tends to lose its importance, the picture can be transferred on
different materials, while relations remain unchanged. The image is not
independent of its channel as the Morse code is of the material employed for i ts standard signals. However, some kind of liberation is
foreshadowed.
Probably because of the above phenomenon, the 'photograph stage'
comes much later than the 'mirror stage' in the subject's ontogenesis. A
baby has no problems in recognizing his image reflected in a mirror,
whereas a child up to five years of age finds it very difficult (and requires
some sort of training) to identify photographed objects. Indeed , he will
perceive images as expressions referring to a generic content and, only
through this connection with the universal, will he refer to the improper
subject. He sees the picture of a woman X, considers it the picture of a
type-woman, applies it to a token-woman Y and finally states that it is a
picture of his mother. He actually fails to refer that proper-improper
name, that slack designator represented by a photographic image. We are
witnessing a semiosic phenomenon.
Our pragmatics of photography reflects the effects of those early mistakes. While testifying that the plate has been exposed to something
(and, in view of that, photographic i mages can be used as evidence), it
nevertheless arouses the suspicion that something has not been there at
all. We know that, through staging, optical tricks, emulsion, solarization,
and the like, someone could have produced the image of something that
did not exist, had not existed, and will never exist. A photograph can lie.
We realize that, even when we assu me, naively, if not under the influence of a fideistic attitude, that it does not. The objective referent is
conjectured and yet, at every moment, it risks dissolving in pure content. Is a photograph the photograph of a man or the photograph of that
man? It depends on how we use it (see Goodman's remarks, 1968). Occasionally, on the basis of a surreptitious reference to general (universal)
content, we take the photograph of X for that of Y. It is not j ust an error 
[224] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
of perception, that is, as if we saw in a mirror the image of X coming in
and thought it was Y. In fact, there is more to it: in any imprint, however well defined, as that of an exposed plate, generic characters ultimately
prevail over specific ones.
Except for catoptric theaters, the choice of the shot in the mirror is
left to me, even when I am spying on someone: I need only move.
Incidentally, if I see a half-length image of myself in a mirror, I need
only get closer and look inside, downward , to see, within limits, that
portion of my body the previous image did not show. The object is
there, to produce the image, even where I did not see it at first. In
contrast, with photographs, the shot is strictly set. I will never get the
chance of seeing those legs if they are not in the image from the start: I
just have to assume their existence (and still it could be the photograph
of a cul-de-jatte). Again, the legs I presuppose are not one's legs, but j ust
one's two-footedness. The impression of actual reference immediately
faces into clusters of content. A photograph is already a semiosic phenomenon.
Second magic experiment: the frozen image moves. Motion pictures,
obviously, to which all the remarks made on photography apply, plus the
actual grammar of editing, with all the deceptive and generalizing effects
it involves. I mprints, but moving ones.
Third experiment: the imprint has a very low definition, the mirror
looks like an i mage freezer, and, on top of that, there is no longer a
guarantee of the existence of a mirror and of a referent for the image.
What I see is not only staging, shot, a selected visual angle, but also the
result of the work done on the surface so that the latter seems to reflect
the rays coming from an object: it is, in fact, a painting. In this case, all
the requirements of semiosic phenomena are met; the physics of production combines with the pragmatics of interpretation in an utterly different way from that of the mirror image.
Our three imaginary experiments have led us to imagine phenomena
no longer related to mirrors. Despite that, when dealing with such
phenomena, we can never totally abandon the memory of the mirror
images of which they are monkeys (the same as art is always simia
naturae).
However, it is worth reconsidering for a moment our experiments involving a sequence of mirrors placed at regular intervals along a row of
hills. Let us assume we replace the sequence of mirrors with other devices turning the light rays coming from the initial object into electric
signals which are then transformed into optical signals by a final device.
The resulting i mage would have the same characteristics as imprints
such as photographs and motion pictures; in other words, they would
enjoy a lower definition than the mirror image (anyway, we decided to 
Mirrors [225]
consider such an inconvenience as only tem porary), they would be
heteromaterial and retranslated (reinverted). And yet, like the chain of
mirrors, such a system would seem to involve a rigid designation: the
image would be determined by the present referent which causes it, and
the relation would be from occurrence to occurrence.
Obviously, such a system, where a schematic model of TV transmission can be detected, would only have this characteristic in case of live
emission. As to the pragmatic attitude, a recorded TV broadcast does not
differ from a film show, except for image definition and type of sensory
stimulus. Only live TV broadcasts would share with mirrors their absolute relation with the referent.
The point is (and this may also apply to the set of mirrors reflecting a
distant image) that j ust the space interval between referent and image
arouses, more or less consciously, a suspicion of potential absence. The
object should be there, but it may even not be. In addition, a further
basic element should be taken into account: recorder emissions give rise
to distrust in the audience as to the truthfulness of live emissions. From
a pragmatic point of view, TV images share the advantages of mirror
i mages as well as the d isadvantages of the other photographic and
motion-picture imprints. It is occurrence, acting as a parasite to the referent, but not necessarily. Who can be sure? And how many and what
manipulationns may have taken place along the channel? And what is
the role played, not only by the shot, but also by the editing, which
influences live broadcasts, too, and through which the camera decides
which aspects of the real referent to explore and the mixing may prod uce
Kuleshov effects at any moment?
However, such comparisons between photosensitive imprints and mirror images tell us at least something which is h ighly important for the
semiotics of photographic, motion-picture, and television images. The
latter lie within the boundaries of semiotics, but certainly not within
those of li nguistics. Each imprint is a projection working as a toposensitive whole, not as a sequence of discrete elements replicable by ratio
foci/is (Eco 1 976, 3.4.9). The way all imprints (which are actual signs)
can be interpreted is similar to the way we interpret a distorted or lowdefined mirror image (which, on the contrary, is not a sign). The process
develops by projective relations, a given dimension must correspond to
the same dimension in the image, if not in the object-occurrence (referent), at least in the object-type (content) the image 'tells' me about.
The actual grammatical categories come into play only in connection
with shooting and editing. Imprints are not mirror images, but we read
them almost as if they were. At a certain level of analysis - when, for
instance, one is concerned only with iconographic conventions - one is
entitled to look at photographic imprints as if they were real mirror im-
[226] SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE
ages, that is, the immediate result of a reflection tout court, and their
semiotic strategies will be investigated only at the highest manipulatory
levels (staging, framing, and so on). In other cases, it would be, on the
contrary, indispensable to cast in doubt their presumed 'in nocence' , to
discuss their cultural origin, the non-naturality of their supposed causal
relation with the referent.
7.16. The experimentum crucis
However strong illusions, ambiguities, confusions 'on the threshold' , and
the temptation to rank together mirror images and imprints may be, the
experimentum crucis will dispel any doubt: j ust reproduce a mirror in a
photograph, in a motion picture or television shot, or in a pai nting.
These images of mirror images do not work as mirror images. There is
no imprint or icon of a mirror other than a mirror. The latter, in the
world of signs, becomes the shadow of its former self: derision, caricature, memory. You can make a portrait, either a photograph or a painting, and assert that it is 'realistic' , truer than the original. With mirrors
there is no truer image than the original's. A catoptric element, capable
of reflecting a semiosic element existi ng independently of it (without
modifying it), cannot, in turn, be reflected by it. The semiosic element
can only generalize it, make it a genus, a scheme, a concept, pure content.
These two universes, of which the former is threshold to the latter,
have no connecting points, the extreme cases represented by distorting
mirrors being in fact 'catastrophe points' . There comes a time when one
has to make up one's mind and choose which side one is on. The catoptric universe is a reality which can give the impression of virtuality,
whereas the semiosic universe is a virtuality which can give the impression of reality.
