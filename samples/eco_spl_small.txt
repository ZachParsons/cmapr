Semiosis is the fundamental process by which signs produce meaning.
Semiosis pervades all communication, culture, and thought.
The process of semiosis was first theorized systematically by Charles Peirce.
Semiosis involves a triadic relation between sign, object, and interpretant.
An interpretant is the meaning or cognitive effect produced by a sign in semiosis.
The interpretant itself functions as a new sign in an unlimited chain of semiosis.
By interpretant I mean the effect that a sign produces in a mind or interpretive system.
The concept of interpretant is the cornerstone of Peircean semiotics.
Semiotics investigates the nature, logic, and structure of sign processes.
Semiotics analyzes codes, conventions, and signification across all domains of culture.
Semiotics is the general science of semiosis in its diverse manifestations.
A sign-vehicle is the perceptible material aspect of a sign in any sign relation.
A sign-vehicle becomes meaningful through its systematic difference from other sign-vehicles.
Sign-vehicles can be sounds, images, words, gestures, or any perceptible forms.
Meaning-variance occurs when identical sign-vehicles receive different interpretants in different codes.
Meaning-variance is a structural property of natural language and cultural signification.
Signification is the process by which sign-vehicles acquire semantic content.
Signification depends on codes and conventions shared by interpretive communities.
Through signification, cultural phenomena become meaningful objects of interpretation.
Consciousness is a necessary condition for semiotic interpretation and recognition.
Consciousness enables the interpreter to perceive sign-vehicles and produce interpretants.
The code establishes the systematic conventions that regulate signification.
A code links sign-vehicles to their conventional meanings and interpretants.
The structure of the code determines how meaning-variance is constrained or multiplied.
Signs are entities defined by their systematic differences within sign systems.
Signs do not designate things directly but mediate through interpretants and codes.
The encyclopedia model represents meaning as an open network of interpretants.
Interpretation requires familiarity with the relevant code and cultural context.
The philosophy of language must engage with the logic of semiosis and signification.
Philosophical analysis reveals that all meaning production is fundamentally semiotic.
