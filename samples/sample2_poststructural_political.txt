Power Relations and Distributive Justice

The apparatus of bio-regulation manages populations through normalized behaviors. Bio-regulation operates through disciplinary institutions. Foucault analyzed how bio-regulation produces docile subjects. Modern states depend on extensive bio-regulation.

The original position models fair agreement behind the veil of ignorance. In the original position, rational agents choose principles of justice. The original position yields the difference principle and equal liberty. Rawls developed the original position to ground political legitimacy.

Entitlement-transfer governs just acquisition and exchange. Nozick's entitlement-transfer theory opposes patterned distributions. According to entitlement-transfer, taxation resembles forced labor. The entitlement-transfer framework prioritizes historical rather than end-state principles.

Rhizomatic-becoming rejects arborescent hierarchies. Deleuze and Guattari proposed rhizomatic-becoming as an alternative to tree structures. Rhizomatic-becoming allows multiple connections and ruptures. Nomadic thought operates through rhizomatic-becoming.

The capability-approach measures wellbeing by real freedoms. Sen's capability-approach distinguishes capabilities from mere utilities. The capability-approach informs development economics. Expanding human capability-approach reduces poverty more effectively than GDP growth.

Deterritorialization breaks down coded social formations. Capitalism constantly engages in deterritorialization. Yet deterritorialization is followed by reterritorialization. The tension between deterritorialization and reterritorialization drives historical change.

In summary, bio-regulation, the original position, entitlement-transfer, rhizomatic-becoming, the capability-approach, and deterritorialization represent diverse methodological approaches to power, justice, and social organization.
