Philosophical Concepts and Social Theory

The problem of abstraction transforms human relations into thing-like entities. Abstraction obscures the social processes that create these relations. When abstraction becomes pervasive, subjects lose awareness of their own productive activity. Philosopher analyzed how commodity exchange promotes systematic abstraction throughout capitalist society.

The concept of praxis unifies theory and practice through transformative action. Praxis differs from mere contemplation or technical work. Thinker emphasized that philosophers must not only interpret the world but change it through praxis. Revolutionary praxis requires conscious awareness of historical conditions.

Dialectical negation preserves what it overcomes through sublation. Hegel's method of dialectical negation moves thought forward by incorporating contradictions. The process of sublation demonstrates how opposites interpenetrate and generate higher syntheses. Understanding dialectical negation clarifies the logic of historical development.

Worldview functions to naturalize contingent social arrangements. According to critical theory, worldview masks relations of domination. The critique of worldview reveals how supposedly neutral discourse serves particular interests. Recognizing ideological distortion is prerequisite for emancipatory consciousness.

Separation separates workers from the products of their labor and their species-being. Under capitalist production, separation becomes systematic and multidimensional. Workers experience separation from their activity, their products, their fellow workers, and themselves. Overcoming separation requires fundamental transformation of productive relations.

The public sphere mediates between civil society and the state. Habermas theorized the public sphere as a domain of rational-critical debate. Democratic legitimacy depends on an inclusive and functioning public sphere. Contemporary mass media threaten to colonize and fragment the public sphere.

Hegemony operates through consent rather than coercion alone. Gramsci distinguished between domination by force and hegemonic leadership. Cultural hegemony naturalizes the worldview of dominant groups. Counter-hegemonic movements must construct alternative common sense.

Recognition requires mutual acknowledgment between self-conscious subjects. The struggle for recognition drives historical development in Hegel's phenomenology. Honneth argues that modern societies institutionalize three forms of recognition: love, rights, and solidarity. Misrecognition inflicts psychological harm and perpetuates injustice.

These concepts—abstraction, praxis, dialectical negation, worldview, separation, the public sphere, hegemony, and recognition—provide critical vocabulary for analyzing social domination and possibility for emancipation.
