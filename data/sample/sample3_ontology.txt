Ontological Structures and Temporal Being

Being-toward-finitude characterizes authentic existence. Being-toward-finitude confronts mortality directly. Only through Being-toward-finitude does existence gain genuine meaning. Being-toward-finitude reveals the temporal structure of care.

The concept of existential-thrownness describes our factical situation. Existential-thrownness precedes choice and freedom. We find ourselves in existential-thrownness without having chosen it. Existential-thrownness conditions all subsequent projects.

Worldhood-disclosure opens the space of possible meanings. Through worldhood-disclosure, entities become intelligible. Worldhood-disclosure is more primordial than propositional truth. Dasein-flux operates within worldhood-disclosure.

Authenticity emerges through resolute confrontation with Being-toward-finitude. Resolute existence accepts existential-thrownness while projecting future possibilities. Through resolute action, Geist-praxis actualizes authentic potential.

The hermeneutic-circle describes the structure of understanding. We always already interpret within the hermeneutic-circle. Breaking out of the hermeneutic-circle is neither possible nor desirable. The hermeneutic-circle reveals understanding as temporal and situated.

In summary, Being-toward-finitude, existential-thrownness, worldhood-disclosure, resolute existence, and the hermeneutic-circle articulate fundamental ontology. These concepts interconnect through the unity of temporal existence.
