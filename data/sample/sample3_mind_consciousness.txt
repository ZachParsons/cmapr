Consciousness, Intentionality, and Mental Content

The concept of phenomenal-character designates the qualitative feel of experience. Phenomenal-character is what makes experiences subjective. Dennett skeptically questions the coherence of phenomenal-character. Understanding phenomenal-character remains central to consciousness studies.

Functional-architecture describes the computational organization of cognitive systems. The mind's functional-architecture processes information through multiple subsystems. Cognitive science investigates functional-architecture empirically. Functional-architecture may be multiply realizable across different substrates.

The explanatory gap separates physical and phenomenal descriptions. Even complete neuroscience would leave an explanatory gap. Levine articulated the explanatory gap without endorsing dualism. The explanatory gap challenges reductive physicalism.

Chinese room scenarios test whether syntax suffices for semantics. Searle's Chinese room argument claims computers lack intentionality. The Chinese room debate divides strong AI proponents from critics. Understanding genuine intentionality requires more than symbol manipulation.

Quale-inversion hypotheses imagine experientially inverted but behaviorally identical beings. If quale-inversion is possible, functionalism faces difficulties. The logical possibility of quale-inversion does not establish its nomological possibility. Debates about quale-inversion illuminate the relationship between consciousness and function.

Intentional stance predicts behavior by attributing beliefs and desires. Dennett argues that intentional stance has pragmatic but not metaphysical significance. Adopting the intentional stance works regardless of true mental states. The intentional stance contrasts with the physical stance and design stance.

Zombie-conceivability arguments suggest consciousness is not necessitated by physical facts. Philosophers debate whether zombie-conceivability implies genuine possibility. Chalmers uses zombie-conceivability to argue against materialism. Critics respond that conceivability does not entail possibility.

Modal-reconfiguration allows mental states to maintain identity across counterfactual scenarios. Questions of modal-reconfiguration test theories of mental content. Externalist theories restrict modal-reconfiguration of content. Modal-reconfiguration debates connect philosophy of mind with metaphysics.

These concepts—phenomenal-character, functional-architecture, the explanatory gap, the Chinese room, quale-inversion, intentional stance, zombie-conceivability, and modal-reconfiguration—structure contemporary philosophy of mind.
