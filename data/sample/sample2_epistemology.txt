Epistemological Investigations into Phenomenal Experience

The phenomenon of noetic-intuition reveals immediate apprehension of essence. Noetic-intuition differs from empirical perception. Through noetic-intuition, consciousness grasps ideal structures directly.

Categorial synthesis unifies manifold impressions into coherent objects. Without categorial synthesis, experience would remain chaotic. Categorial synthesis operates pre-reflectively in all cognition.

The structure of intentionality-vectors directs consciousness toward objects. Every act of consciousness exhibits intentionality-vectors. Understanding intentionality-vectors illuminates the nature of meaning-constitution. Intentionality-vectors connect subjective acts with objective correlates.

Eidetic reduction brackets contingent facts to reveal essential forms. Through eidetic reduction, we discover invariant structures. Eidetic reduction complements noetic-intuition in phenomenological method. The practice of eidetic reduction requires disciplined attention.

Lifeworld-horizons contextualize all theoretical knowledge. Scientific abstractions presuppose pre-theoretical lifeworld-horizons. Recovering lifeworld-horizons grounds epistemology in lived experience. Lifeworld-horizons constitute the ultimate foundation of meaning.

These five concepts—noetic-intuition, categorial synthesis, intentionality-vectors, eidetic reduction, and lifeworld-horizons—form the basis of rigorous epistemology.
